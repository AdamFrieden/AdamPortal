### **Title (Working)**: *StarClans*

---

## **High-Level Pitch **

*A fantasy football-inspired idle management game where you recruit, train, and roster gladiators for automated battles across a dangerous galaxy. The twist? Gladiator stats and traits are partially hidden, and qualitative, LLM-generated descriptions give subtle clues about their strengths, weaknesses, and potential—forcing players to strategize with imperfect information.*

## **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. **Recruit Gladiators**  
   - Acquire gladiators with **hidden stats** (true power, potential, traits). You only see an **estimated power level** with some random noise, and a **textual blurb** generated by an LLM hinting at their abilities or flaws.
   
2. **Scan for Conflicts**  
   - Initiate **scans** from your **Clan Ship** (your mobile base) to discover new conflicts, derelict ships, and resource caches. Scans take real-time to complete and yield **0–3 events** that remain active for a limited period.

3. **Roster Gladiators for Battles**  
   - Select which gladiators to send into conflicts based on their **estimated power**, **stamina**, and known/unknown traits.  
   - Conflicts resolve using a **lightweight fantasy football-style system**: each gladiator rolls based on their power, stamina level, traits, and random factors.

4. **Recover, Train, and Repeat**  
   - Gladiators lose stamina (and possibly gain injuries). While they rest or train, players manage the next scans, recruit new gladiators, or upgrade their **Clan Ship**.

## **Key Mechanics & Unique Selling Points**

1. **Fantasy Football-Style Idle Management**  
   - At its heart, the game is about **assembling the right team** for each conflict—like fantasy sports, but with gladiators and sci-fi flair.  
   - Players must balance **stamina management**, **trait synergies**, and the **risk/reward** of taking on harder conflicts.

2. **Hidden Stats + LLM-Generated Descriptions**  
   - Gladiators have **hidden true power levels** and potential. Players only see a **noisy estimated power** and qualitative hints from **LLM-generated flavor text**.  
   - Over time, as gladiators participate in conflicts, their **estimated power** adjusts based on performance, slowly revealing their true capabilities.  
   - Some traits are **hidden** and only become apparent through observation or special events.

3. **Risk vs. Reward via Zone Progression**  
   - The game world is divided into **three zones**:  
     1. **Safe Space** (low risk/reward)  
     2. **Frontier Space** (moderate)  
     3. **Deep Space** (high risk/reward)  
   - Players move their **Clan Ship** between zones, with **idle travel time** increasing as they venture deeper. Deeper zones yield tougher conflicts, better rewards, and increased chances of **raids on the Clan Ship** by space pirates or rival clans.

4. **Stamina System**  
   - Gladiators have stamina that impacts both **availability** and **performance**.  
   - Each conflict consumes stamina incrementally as the battle “plays out.” Lower stamina means **reduced effectiveness** in future conflicts, encouraging strategic roster rotation.

## **Player Decision-Making & Strategy**

1. **Recruitment Strategy**  
   - Do you gamble on a gladiator with a promising LLM description but low estimated power? Or play it safe with a known quantity?

2. **Roster Management**  
   - Which gladiators are best suited for specific conflicts, considering **stamina levels**, **known traits**, and **hidden potentials**?  
   - How do you balance **short-term victories** with **long-term gladiator growth**?

3. **Exploration Choices**  
   - Do you risk moving to **Frontier Space** or **Deep Space** for bigger rewards and tougher conflicts?  
   - How do you prepare for potential **raids** on your Clan Ship while your best gladiators are out fighting?

4. **Resource & Stamina Management**  
   - When do you **rest** vs. **push forward**? Do you use **consumables** to keep key gladiators fighting, or let them recover naturally?  
   - How do you **balance** gladiator **training** with **conflict participation** to maximize growth and effectiveness?

## **Why This Game Stands Out**

1. **Blend of Familiar and Innovative**  
   - Combines the **accessible, engaging loop** of fantasy football with **idle game progression**, while introducing the fresh mechanic of **LLM-generated hidden information**.

2. **Strategic Depth with Simplicity**  
   - The core systems are easy to grasp, but the hidden traits, stamina interactions, and conflict risk/reward dynamics create meaningful strategic choices.

3. **Narrative & Atmosphere**  
   - The use of **LLM-generated descriptions** adds a **personalized narrative layer** to each gladiator, making them feel more like unique characters rather than just stat blocks.

### **Quick Elevator Pitch**

*"Imagine fantasy football meets gladiator battles in space. You recruit warriors with hidden stats, revealed slowly through performance and AI-generated hints. You scan the galaxy for conflicts, manage your team’s stamina, traits, and training —balancing risk and reward as you push deeper into dangerous territory."*
