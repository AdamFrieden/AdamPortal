High-Level Summary

    Core Mechanic: You initiate a scan from your Clan Ship, wait an idle duration (X hours), and then receive 0–3 “points of interest” or “events.”
    Points of Interest: Could be conflicts, derelict ships, resource caches, or special challenges.
    Availability: These events remain accessible for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours, or until a new scan is done), regardless of your current zone.
    Immediate Engagement: Players can roster gladiators and attempt any scanned conflict at will, as long as it’s still active.

This is a solid foundation for your scanning system: it ties into the idle aspect (long wait times), offers a sense of discovery, and gives players control over which events they tackle.
2. Why It Fits Well

    Idle / Time-Gated Loop
        Scanning provides a meaningful reason to come back later.
        It ensures conflict generation isn’t just automatic or spammy—players must plan scans and await results.

    Ties to Risk vs. Reward Zones
        If you’re in Safe Space, the scans might yield simpler or lower-tier conflicts.
        In Frontier or Deep Space, the scan results might escalate in difficulty (and reward).
        This fits your overarching theme of increasing stakes as you progress deeper.

    Enhances Strategic Choice
        If you find multiple conflicts from a single scan, you can only field so many gladiators at once (or have limited stamina).
        You must prioritize which events are most beneficial or time-sensitive.

3. Potential Tweaks & Refinements
A. Scan Variants or Upgrades

    Basic Scan
        Default action available from the start. Takes, say, 6 hours and yields up to 2 points of interest.

    Advanced Scan (Unlocked Later)
        Possibly a hardware or tech upgrade that reduces scan time or increases the number of potential discoveries.
        E.g., “Scan Level 2: Takes 4 hours, yields up to 3 points of interest.”
        Gives a sense of progression in scanning capabilities.

    Specialized Scans
        Optionally, the user can focus the scan on “Combat Targets” or “Resource Caches.”
        This is an additional layer of strategy (“I need more hardware parts, so I’ll do a Resource-Focused Scan”).

B. Event Lifespan & Overlap

    Event Duration
        If events remain active indefinitely, players might hoard them.
        Consider a time limit (e.g., each scanned event expires after 48 hours or after you initiate a new scan).
        This encourages engagement and prevents backlog bloat.

    Scan Queue or Cooldown
        If you want players to manage scanning frequency, you can either:
            Prevent new scans until all discovered events expire or are completed.
            Or allow them to do a new scan but it overwrites the old results.
        This ensures scanning is a deliberate action, not a spam tactic.

C. Reward & Difficulty Calibration

    Zone-Based Difficulty
        If you’re in Frontier Space, the discovered events might have a recommended power level between (say) 15–25.
        In Deep Space, they might be 25+ or special boss-tier conflicts.
        This ties scanning results closely to the player’s chosen zone.

    Variety of Outcomes
        Not just conflicts; sometimes you discover a mini-“treasure hunt” with mild hazards, or you find a “Distressed Ship” event that can yield extra recruits.
        Keeps the scanning mechanic feeling fresh and worth the wait.

D. Narrative Hook

    To reinforce the game’s space-raider vibe, each scan result can be accompanied by a small LLM-generated snippet:

        “Our sensors have detected a drifting hulk near the ion storm. It appears to be a derelict cruiser—scavenging might be dangerous, but the salvage is valuable.”

    This immerses players and ties scanning to the overarching clan ship narrative.

4. Is It Adding Unnecessary Complexity?

    No, if you keep it simple and clearly explained. For an idle/management game, scanning is a core driver of new encounters, preventing monotony in the conflict cycle.
    It’s easy to prototype:
        Add a “Scan” button.
        Show a “Scan in progress…” bar or countdown.
        Reveal a list of events upon completion.
        The user chooses whether (and when) to engage them.

5. Examples of a Full “Scan & Engage” Flow

    Player in Frontier Space:
        Click “Initiate Scan (6h).”
        They log off or do other tasks for 6 hours.
    Scan Complete:
        3 events discovered:
            Raider Outpost (Conflicts: Power ~ 20).
            Ancient Derelict (Exploration event: minimal combat, possible high-tech loot).
            Small Beast Hunt (Hazard-based conflict: recommended Hazard-Proof trait).
        Each event is available for 48 hours.
    Decision:
        The player sees their gladiators’ stamina, checks if some are injured, and rosters a team for the Raider Outpost.
        Meanwhile, they might let the Beast Hunt wait until a certain gladiator recovers from injury.
    Result:
        They engage conflicts on their schedule, collecting rewards and possibly unlocking new gear.
        If they fail or don’t engage within the event’s timer, that event expires.

Outcome: The scanning process adds a layer of planning and anticipation to the game loop without major complexity.
6. Final Thoughts

Your initial brainstorming is on point:

    Core mechanic: Time-gated scanning.
    0–3 points of interest keeps it varied and unpredictable.
    Availability window ensures players can tackle them at their own pace.
    Instant engagement fits the idle style—no separate travel needed to move to the conflict.

Just ensure you have clear UI or tutorial guidance so players understand how scanning cycles work and how they can maximize their scanning benefits. This system naturally ties into your three-zone difficulty progression, letting players scan deeper regions for bigger finds—or stick to safer scans if they’re not ready for the more dangerous content.
