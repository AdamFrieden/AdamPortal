Below are several example gladiators that illustrate how the **hidden vs. public** information might work. Each example shows:

1. **Private Stats**: What the game engine (and developer/GM) sees, including true power level, maximum potential, hidden traits, and so forth.  
2. **Public View**: What the *player* sees in the roster. This includes an **estimated** power level, partial trait hints, and a brief LLM-generated descriptive blurb.

## 1. “Aeron the Fading Ember”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 78  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 125  
- **Stamina:** 42 / 50  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **Underhanded Advantage** – Gains +5 to combat roll when facing opponents with lower true power.  
  2. **Slow Recovery** – Stamina recovery speed reduced by 20%.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 70 (± 10)  
- **Stamina:** 42 (public stamina is typically known or can be toggled to show how tired the gladiator is)  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (Player might see something like “Ruthless tactics suspected” or “Seems a bit sluggish in practice.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Aeron moves with cautious grace, never one to attack head-on. Rumors abound of quick finishes when facing weaker foes, though he appears to tire faster than most.”*

## 2. “Galora the Starbound Hulk”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 120  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 180  
- **Stamina:** 60 / 60  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **High Ceiling** – Potential is significantly higher than normal (max 180).  
  2. **Reduced Hazard Damage** – Takes 15% less from environmental or hazard-based conflicts.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 110 (± 15)  
- **Stamina:** 60  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (Player might only see a vague mention like “Hardy constitution” or “Can endure environmental risks well.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Galora stands tall, her frame braced against storms and traps alike. Whispers say her true strength is yet to be fully unleashed.”*

## 3. “Telrin the Wisp-Fingered Sniper”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 40  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 90  
- **Stamina:** 25 / 40  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **Sharpshooter** – Bonus +10 to rolls in conflicts that favor ranged combat.  
  2. **Fragile** – Takes 20% extra damage from direct confrontation.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 35 (± 5)  
- **Stamina:** 25  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (maybe “Focused ranged specialist” or “Seems wary of direct melee.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Telrin rarely speaks, but her aim is rumored to be devastating when given space. One misstep in close-quarters, however, and she could fall like a reed.”*

## 4. “Raktash the Reaver”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 95  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 95 (maxed out)  
- **Stamina:** 50 / 50  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **Fast Power Trainer** – *Already used up; Raktash is near his maximum.*  
  2. **Berserker Fury** – Gains +10 to rolls once stamina is below 25%.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 100 (± 5) — interestingly it’s slightly *overestimated*  
- **Stamina:** 50  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (Possible clue: “Battle fervor suspected.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Raktash’s roar can be heard across the arena, fueling wild speculation that he grows more dangerous as fatigue sets in. But perhaps he has already reached his peak.”*

*(Note that the public estimate is higher than the true power, meaning the user might initially overvalue Raktash.)*

## 5. “Aurilia the Grey Seer”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 65  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 150  
- **Stamina:** 30 / 40  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **Mystic Vision** – Has a small chance (5%) to outright nullify an opponent’s strongest attack.  
  2. **Sluggish Melee** – -5 penalty in standard, non-magical melee conflicts.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 60 (± 10)  
- **Stamina:** 30  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (Might show something like “Suspected mystical edge” or “Weak in direct confrontation.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Aurilia’s eyes gleam with unearthly insight; some swear she foretells the moves of her foes. In close combat, though, she seems hesitant and unsure.”*

---

## 6. “Sunder the Shield-Breaker”

### **Private Stats**  
- **Power (True):** 85  
- **Power Potential (Max):** 130  
- **Stamina:** 20 / 50 (arrived injured or drained)  
- **Traits (Hidden):**  
  1. **Status Ailment**: Mild Leg Injury – Movement penalty (reduces base power by 5 until healed).  
  2. **Hazard-Proof** – -10% damage from traps and environment.  

### **Public View**  
- **Estimated Power:** 75 (± 10)  
- **Stamina:** 20  
- **Visible/Partially Known Traits:** ??? (Might appear as “Physical condition uncertain, rumored to endure hazards well.”)  
- **LLM-Generated Blurb:**  
  > *“Sunder’s footing seems unsteady, as though he carries a recent wound. Yet he strides through molten pits and icy shards unscathed, breaking every barrier in his path.”*

# How Players Might See & Interpret These Gladiators

- **Estimated Power**: Shows a single number or a small range—e.g. *75 ± 10*.  
- **Stamina**: Typically more transparent (because stamina usage is vital for planning).  
- **Blurb**: The key source of “soft” info. It could highlight contradictory cues about the gladiator’s real power, potential, or hidden traits.  
- **Trait Hints**:  
  - The player sees short hints: “Suspected ‘Ruthless tactics’” or “Likely strong in traps.”  
  - The full detail—“Underhanded Advantage,” “Reduced Hazard Damage,” etc.—remains hidden until discovered via repeated use or specialized scanning modules.

By combining these private vs. public stats, **players must experiment** in different conflicts or training regimens to see how accurate those estimated stats are and to gradually reveal hidden strengths or weaknesses. This adds both excitement and planning depth to the gladiator management loop.
