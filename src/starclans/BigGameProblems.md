Below is a critical analysis outlining several major design challenges that must be addressed to ensure the game remains engaging, strategic, and fun:

---

### 1. Dominant “Wait for Full Stamina” Strategy

- **Problem:**  
  If players find that simply waiting until their top gladiators reach 100% stamina guarantees victory, it undercuts the strategic tension and risk/reward trade-off that’s central to the design.
  
- **Why It’s a Big Issue:**  
  - It removes meaningful decision-making—players may rely on a “safe mode” rather than planning varied strategies or experimenting with roster configurations.
  - It contradicts the goal of encouraging dynamic, on-the-fly re-strategizing and exploration of risk (i.e., venturing into deeper space).
  
- **Points to Address:**  
  - Introduce diminishing returns or penalties for waiting too long (e.g., time-sensitive opportunities, enemy adaptations, or partial stamina recovery that doesn’t fully offset losses).
  - Create incentives to engage in conflict before full recovery, such as bonus rewards for overcoming challenges with less-than-perfect conditions or dynamic events that force players to act.

### 2. Uncertainty and Insufficient Predictability in Conflict Outcomes

- **Problem:**  
  If a player narrowly loses a match and the system doesn’t provide clear indicators of their likelihood of success, the experience can feel arbitrary or frustrating.
  
- **Why It’s a Big Issue:**  
  - Players need to feel that they have enough information (via estimated power levels, qualitative clues, and recommended power ranges) to plan effectively.
  - Without proper feedback, narrow losses might lead to excessive downtime, making players feel punished by fate rather than challenged.
  
- **Points to Address:**  
  - Enhance transparency by offering clear cues—through UI elements, visual effects, or narrative hints—about a gladiator’s current effective strength (factoring in stamina) and the overall risk of a conflict.
  - Consider soft outcomes for narrow losses (e.g., partial progress or minor rewards) to reduce the punitive impact of a near miss.

### 3. Punishing Consequences for Narrow Losses

- **Problem:**  
  A conflict lost by a small margin that forces long recovery times or major setbacks may turn a tense moment into a discouraging experience.
  
- **Why It’s a Big Issue:**  
  - Idle games need to strike a balance between risk and downtime; if every loss means a long wait for recovery, players might feel that their progress is constantly stalled.
  - This could lead to frustration and reduced engagement, especially if the player feels that a small twist of fate can negate hours of planning.
  
- **Points to Address:**  
  - Implement mechanics that cushion the blow of near losses—such as reduced penalties when the margin is slim or gradual scaling of the recovery cost.
  - Offer opportunities to “bounce back” (for example, through consumables or strategic mid-conflict decisions) so that a narrow loss doesn’t feel like a dead end.

### 4. Balancing Simplicity with Engagement in Conflict Resolution

- **Problem:**  
  A lightweight, one-round fantasy football style conflict is approachable but risks feeling too simplistic if it doesn’t capture tension or strategic nuance.
  
- **Why It’s a Big Issue:**  
  - The core conflict mechanic must be fast and accessible while still conveying the drama of battle—through dynamic visual feedback (e.g., micro-ticks, gradual stamina drain, partial score reveals) that keeps the experience “juicy.”
  - Too much simplicity may leave little room for strategic decisions, while too much complexity might alienate casual or idle players.
  
- **Points to Address:**  
  - Integrate short, real-time “micro-ticks” where partial points are revealed and stamina bars update, giving a sense of an unfolding battle without bogging down gameplay.
  - Ensure that any added layers (e.g., trait callouts, consumable interventions) are intuitive and reinforce the overall strategic depth rather than detract from the simplicity.

### 5. Managing Idle Progression vs. Active Decision-Making

- **Problem:**  
  The interplay between idle time-based recovery (stamina regeneration, travel time) and active conflict decisions must be carefully balanced.
  
- **Why It’s a Big Issue:**  
  - Overly long idle periods can sap player engagement, while too much active management might overwhelm the intended idle/management feel.
  - Players should feel that every decision—whether waiting to recover or engaging in a riskier conflict—has clear trade-offs and impacts progression.
  
- **Points to Address:**  
  - Fine-tune idle timers, cooldowns, and recovery rates so that they feel like meaningful choices rather than arbitrary delays.
  - Consider integrating occasional “fast-forward” options or mini-interactions during idle periods to maintain engagement without compromising the sense of progression.

### Final Thoughts

The biggest challenges lie in:
- Preventing a dominant strategy that reduces gameplay to “wait for full stamina.”
- Ensuring that conflict outcomes are both engaging and predictable enough to foster strategic planning.
- Mitigating the punitive nature of narrow losses, which could otherwise discourage players.
- Balancing simplicity and depth so that the core conflict feels both fast-paced and meaningful.
- Seamlessly integrating idle recovery mechanics with active, strategic decision-making.

By addressing these issues, you can maintain the integrity of your core design pillars—iterative, modular gameplay; meaningful progress; strategic re-planning; and a satisfying blend of hidden information with clear player agency.
