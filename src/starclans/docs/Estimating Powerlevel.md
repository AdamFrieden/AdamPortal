Below is a **simple, incremental algorithm** to generate and refine a “noisy” estimated power level. It starts with an initial guess (offset by random noise) and then adjusts that guess after every conflict, using actual performance as feedback. You can adapt the details (magnitude of noise, how quickly to update, etc.) to suit your game’s balance.

---

## 1. Initialization

1. **True Power (`T`)**: Internally known only to the game engine (e.g., `T = 12`).
2. **Initial Noise**: Generate a small random offset to simulate scanner errors.
   ```pseudo
   noise = random_in_range(-2, +2)  // or use a small Gaussian, e.g., N(0, 2)
   ```
3. **Estimated Power (`E`)**: 
   ```pseudo
   E = T + noise
   ```
4. **Confidence/Uncertainty (`C`)**:  
   - (Optional) Track how confident we are about our estimate. Initialize to something like `C = 0` or `C = 1`, depending on how you’ll handle it.

This gives you a plausible starting point that’s off by a small margin from the true power.

## 2. Conflict Resolution & Data Gathering

When a gladiator participates in a conflict, they produce an **actual performance result** (`R`). This result might be:
- A single roll (if you have a fantasy-football-style system), e.g. `R = T + random_variance`.
- A sum of multiple round outcomes (in a multi-stage conflict).
- Some other composite performance metric.

**Key idea**: Use `R` as a clue to how accurate your estimate (`E`) is.

---

## 3. Updating the Estimate

After each conflict, **incrementally adjust** `E` based on the difference between `R` (actual performance) and `E` (current estimate). A **simple linear update** (sometimes called exponential smoothing) can look like this:

```pseudo
difference = R - E
E = E + α * difference
```

Where:
- **`difference`** = How far off your estimate was from the observed performance.
- **`α`** (alpha) = A small constant (e.g., 0.1 to 0.3) that controls how quickly you adjust your estimate.  
  - A **higher alpha** means faster adaptation to new data but more volatility.  
  - A **lower alpha** means slower adaptation but more stability.

### Example
- Current `E = 10`
- New conflict performance `R = 14`
- `difference = 14 - 10 = 4`
- If `α = 0.2`,  
  - `E_new = 10 + 0.2 * 4 = 10 + 0.8 = 10.8`

Over multiple conflicts, `E` converges toward the gladiator’s true average performance (which in turn is influenced by `T` plus any trait-based or random factors).

---

## 4. Managing Confidence (Optional)

You can track how many times (or how consistently) you’ve updated `E`. With each conflict, your estimate should become more reliable. For example:
1. **Number of Conflicts (`n`)**: Increase by 1 each time the gladiator fights.
2. **Confidence/Variance**: If you want to display an **estimated power range** rather than a single number, you could do:
   \[
   \text{margin of error} \approx \frac{K}{\sqrt{n}}
   \]
   where `K` is a tuning constant indicating how random conflicts tend to be.

So if a gladiator has fought 1 conflict, you might show `E ± 3`, whereas after 9 conflicts, it might be `E ± 1`.

---

## 5. Practical Display in the UI

- **Display a rounded integer**: e.g., `floor(E + 0.5)`.
- **Optional Range**: Show `E` along with a small plus/minus margin. For instance:  
  > Estimated Power: **11 ± 2**  
- **Flavor Text**: You can still accompany the numeric estimate with an LLM-generated “confidence blurb” or mention “The scanners remain uncertain” if the margin is large.

---

## 6. Putting It All Together (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
// Initialization after recruiting or discovering a new gladiator
function initEstimatedPower(T):
    noise = random_in_range(-2, +2) 
    E = T + noise
    n = 0  // number of conflicts seen
    return E, n

// After each conflict
function updateEstimatedPower(E, n, R, alpha):
    difference = R - E
    E = E + alpha * difference
    n = n + 1
    return E, n

// Display
function getDisplayRange(E, n):
    // Example margin-of-error approach
    K = 3.0  // tune based on how big the random factor is in your game
    margin = K / sqrt(n + 1)  // +1 so we don't divide by zero
    lowerBound = floor(E - margin + 0.5)
    upperBound = floor(E + margin + 0.5)
    return lowerBound, upperBound
```

- **`n + 1`** ensures that even if no conflicts have been observed, you don’t divide by zero.  
- Over time, as `n` grows, the margin decreases, reflecting increased **confidence** in the estimate.

---

## 7. Adjusting for Hidden Traits & Complexity

- If a hidden trait **amplifies** or **dampens** performance in certain contexts (e.g., hazards, boss fights), `R` might deviate significantly from `E` in those situations. Over many conflicts, the estimate adjusts accordingly, even without the player knowing the root cause.  
- For a more advanced approach, you could store separate estimates for different **conflict types** or conditions, but that’s optional. Keep it simple unless you really want specialized reveals.

# Final Notes

This **incremental, noisy-estimate approach** helps maintain:
- **Mystery** (the player never sees the exact value).  
- **Consistency** (the estimate gradually aligns with performance).  
- **Player Agency** (they can do small “test” conflicts to gather more data on a gladiator’s real power).

By tuning parameters (initial noise range, alpha, how you display confidence), you can create a satisfying sense of discovery and progression without overwhelming complexity.
