Below is a **self-contained prompt** you can use (or adapt) when calling an LLM to **generate new gladiators**. This prompt assumes you want **JSON output** that your React/TypeScript application can easily parse. It also includes **“knobs”** (parameters) so that you can control the kinds of gladiators that appear (e.g., difficulty, trait frequency, etc.). Feel free to adjust names and fields to match your exact data models.

## **Example Prompt for Generating Gladiators**

You are a generator of futuristic gladiator data for an idle/management game. Your job is to produce a structured JSON array of gladiators. Each gladiator represents a unique character with partially hidden stats and traits.*Do not include any additional commentary—only output valid JSON matching the specification below.

Follow these rules and format exactly:
1. Output only JSON—no markdown formatting, no extra text.  
2. Each gladiator object must contain the following fields:
  - id (string): A unique identifier for the gladiator.  
  - name (string): The gladiator’s public name.  
  - truePower (number): The hidden true combat power (integer).  
  - potential (number): The hidden maximum power potential (integer, usually ≥ truePower).  
  - stamina (number): The current stamina (0–100).  
  - estimatedPower (number): A noisy estimate of their power visible to the player.  
  - publicTraits (array of objects): Traits or special abilities that are known to the player. Each trait object should include:
     - traitName (string)  
     - description (string): A short effect summary.  
   - hiddenTraits (array of objects): Traits or special abilities not initially visible to the player. Each trait object should include:
     - traitName (string)  
     - description (string): A short effect summary.  
  - descriptor (string): A brief, flavor-text style description or backstory, hinting at truePower, potential, and hidden traits. (This is generated by you.)
3. Produce N gladiator objects in a JSON array, where **N** is given in the prompt.  
4. Each gladiator’s data should be **consistent** (e.g., potential ≥ truePower).  
5. Vary the traits and descriptor text so each gladiator feels unique.  
6. Honor the “knobs” provided in the prompt (if any), such as minPower, maxPower, maxHiddenTraits, minStamina, etc.
7. Check your work!

TASK: Generate N = 5 gladiators using the following constraints:
 - minPower: 5  
 - maxPower: 20  
 - minStamina: 50  
 - maxStamina: 100  
 - maxHiddenTraits: 0-1  
 - maxPublicTraits: 0-1
 - theme: “Space Barbarians, Gritty, Dystopian"
 - potential should be anywhere between 10% to 150% higher than truePower
 - 
 
OUTPUT IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "truePower": 0,
    "potential": 0,
    "stamina": 0,
    "estimatedPower": 0,
    "publicTraits": [
      {
        "traitName": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "hiddenTraits": [
      {
        "traitName": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "description": "string"
  },
  ...

 ## Example Prompt for Generating Avatars

 Generate a series of minimalist sci-fi profile portraits suitable for avatar icons in a modern UI (like MUI). Each character should be shown from the neck up, centered, and designed for clarity at small sizes. Use a dark, gritty background with subtle neon accents. Characters include futuristic gladiators and space barbarians—distinct through helmets, masks, or cybernetic features. Keep the color palette minimal (grayscale with occasional electric blue, red, or orange highlights). Style should be crisp and stylized, not photorealistic, with clear silhouettes that read well in small circular frames.

     Create a 2x2 grid of futuristic avatar portraits, showing four gritty gladiators. Each portrait is a close-up of the character’s head and shoulders. Use a dark sci-fi/fantasy theme with retro lighting, neon accents, and a minimal grainy style.

    Generate based on these character descriptions:

        A brutish cyborg with orange-glowing eyes, half-metal jaw, and battle scars.

        A treefolk assassin with bark-covered features and glowing blue leaves in her hood.

        A reptilian gladiator with magma scales and a molten eye, wearing ceremonial armor.

       A sleek female StarClans scout with a chromed helmet visor and glowing data lines on her collar.
