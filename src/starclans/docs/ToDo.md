### ToDo:
- Add cache busting
- skeleton loading while the user waits on the page
- research 1 tech at a time workflow
- scan for conflict, roster gladiator, resolve workflow
- show api processing on relevant gladiator cards
- make gladiator cards clickable instead of ... dropdown option
- alt gladiator card that is a 'row' / horizontal view appropriate for a mobile list


#### Next Battle Steps:
- add button for loading some gladiators from state
- add button for loading some enemies from state
- update projected power for each side / projected chance of winning
- add button to resolve conflict -> randomly roll actual values and pick a winning side



## Design Brainstorming
- just use certain times during the day that events play out?
