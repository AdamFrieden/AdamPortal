Hybrid Approach (Stamina + Time Factor)

Concept

    You keep a basic stamina bar for each gladiator, but the drain (and possibly recovery) is tied to real-time.
    Could be a combination: each conflict instantly consumes 20 stamina, and it also puts a short cooldown on that gladiator’s usage.

How It Works

    Conflict: Gladiator loses 20 stamina, plus a 1-hour cooldown. (add some noise to the stamina loss)
    Stamina Regen: Goes up passively by 5 stamina/hour.
    Consumables: Instantly restore stamina or skip cooldown.
    Balance: Enough complexity for those who enjoy resource management, but each piece is still straightforward.

Pros

    Depth: The synergy of a numeric stamina system plus short forced cooldown can create interesting pacing.
    Flexible: You can tune numbers (cooldown length, stamina cost, regen speed) to shape the game’s tempo.

Cons

    Two-Layer Complexity: Must teach players how both the stamina meter and the cooldown interact.
    Possible Overkill: If the game is meant to be ultra-casual, two separate gating mechanisms might feel heavy.

Choosing the Right System

    Game Complexity:
        If you want a really casual vibe, consider the cooldown approach or a simple cost system.
        If you want slightly deeper resource management and synergy with traits/hardware, a stamina performance or hybrid system can be rewarding.

    Thematic Fit:
        If your gladiators often get “exhausted” or injured, a stamina bar that impacts performance might be thematically stronger.
        If the game is about planning rosters over daily or weekly cycles (fantasy-football style), a cooldown or daily attempt system might suffice.

    Scalability:
        Simple cost or cooldown systems are easier to scale, as you only adjust cost/cooldown times.
        Performance-based stamina ties more deeply into conflict calculations, so it may require more balancing as the game evolves.

    User Experience:
        Always check if your system is intuitive. If players can’t easily predict and plan, they might get frustrated.

Ultimately, any of these systems (or hybrids thereof) can integrate well with your one-round fantasy football approach, as long as you clearly communicate stamina usage, draining, and recovery times to the player.
