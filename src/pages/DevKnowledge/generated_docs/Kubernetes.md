# Kubernetes

> Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Overview
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a container orchestration system that simplifies the deployment and management of applications in a clustered environment. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes addresses the operational challenges of deploying and managing containerized applications at scale, providing a robust framework for running distributed systems.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than deployment mechanics.
- It manages containerized applications across a cluster of machines, providing tools for deploying applications, scaling them as needed, and managing changes to existing containerized applications.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Automated Scheduling**: Efficiently schedules containers across nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Easily scales applications up or down with a simple command or automatically based on CPU usage.
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Automatically exposes containers using DNS names or IP addresses and balances the load across them.
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Manages application updates and rollbacks seamlessly.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and can be complex to set up and manage.
- **Resource Overhead**: Running Kubernetes requires significant resources, which might not be ideal for small-scale applications.
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires ongoing maintenance and monitoring to ensure optimal performance.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When deploying microservices, needing high availability, or managing large-scale applications.
- **Avoid**: For simple applications or when resources are limited, consider simpler alternatives like Docker Compose.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- **Alternatives**: Docker Swarm, HashiCorp Nomad, AWS Fargate.

## Common Misconceptions
- Kubernetes is not a Platform as a Service (PaaS); it provides the building blocks for developers to create their own PaaS.
- Kubernetes does not manage source code or build processes; it focuses on deployment and scaling.
