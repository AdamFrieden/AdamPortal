# Time Series Databases

> Specialized databases optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data efficiently.

## Overview
Time Series Databases (TSDBs) are designed to handle data points indexed in time order. They are crucial for applications that require tracking changes over time, such as monitoring systems, financial tickers, and IoT data streams. Their architecture is optimized for high write and query performance, particularly for time-based queries.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Store and retrieve time-stamped data efficiently.
- Optimize for append operations and time-based queries.
- Support for data retention policies and downsampling.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Efficient Data Ingestion**: High throughput for continuous data streams.
- **Time-based Queries**: Fast retrieval of data over specific time ranges.
- **Compression**: Effective storage through time-based data compression.
- **Retention Policies**: Automatically manage data lifecycle and storage costs.
- **Downsampling & Aggregation**: Reduce data granularity for long-term storage.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Limited Transactional Support**: Not ideal for complex transactions.
- **Schema Flexibility**: Less flexible schema changes compared to relational databases.
- **Data Overhead**: Potentially high storage requirements if not managed properly.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: Monitoring systems, IoT data collection, financial data analysis.
- **Avoid When**: Complex transactional requirements, non-time-based data.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus.
- **Alternatives**: Relational databases with time-series extensions, NoSQL databases for non-time-centric data.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: TSDBs are only for large-scale applications.
- **Reality**: They are beneficial for any application with time-stamped data needs.
- **Myth**: TSDBs replace all other database types.
- **Reality**: They complement other databases, not replace them.
