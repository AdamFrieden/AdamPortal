# Caching Strategies

> Caching strategies optimize data retrieval by storing copies of data for faster access, reducing latency and load on primary data sources.

## Overview
Caching strategies are techniques used to temporarily store copies of data in a cache to improve data retrieval speed and reduce the load on primary data sources. They exist to enhance performance, scalability, and user experience by minimizing the time and resources required to access frequently requested data.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Cache data that is expensive to retrieve or compute.
- Use cache to serve repeated requests quickly.
- Balance between cache freshness and resource efficiency.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces latency by serving data from a faster, local cache.
- **Scalability**: Offloads demand from primary data sources, allowing systems to handle more requests.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Decreases computational and network resource usage.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Staleness**: Cached data may become outdated, leading to stale reads.
- **Complexity**: Implementing and maintaining caching logic can add complexity.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Ensuring cache consistency and timely invalidation is challenging.
- **Storage Overhead**: Caches require additional storage, which can be costly.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When data retrieval is slow or resource-intensive, and data changes infrequently.
- **Avoid**: When data must always be real-time accurate, or cache storage costs outweigh benefits.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Redis, Memcached for in-memory caching.
- **Patterns**: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for web content caching.
- **Alternatives**: Database indexing, data replication.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"Cache is always faster"**: Not if cache misses occur frequently.
- **"Caching solves all performance issues"**: Only addresses data retrieval speed, not other bottlenecks.
