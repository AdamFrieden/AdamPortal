# Distributed Systems Concepts

> Distributed systems enable multiple computers to work together to achieve a common goal, offering scalability, fault tolerance, and resource sharing. Understanding these systems is crucial for designing robust, efficient, and scalable applications.

## Core Idea
- **Definition**: A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
- **Scalability**: They allow systems to scale horizontally by adding more machines, accommodating increased loads.
- **Fault Tolerance**: By distributing tasks, these systems can continue operating even if some components fail.
- **Resource Sharing**: They enable resource sharing across multiple machines, optimizing utilization.

## Key Features
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control, reducing bottlenecks and single points of failure.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple processes can run simultaneously, improving performance.
- **Transparency**: Users perceive the system as a single entity, hiding the complexity of the underlying infrastructure.
- **Consistency Models**: Various models (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency) define how data is synchronized across nodes.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use**: To handle large-scale applications requiring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
- **When to Use**: Ideal for applications with high traffic, such as social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and cloud services.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - **Complexity**: Increased complexity in design, development, and debugging.
  - **Network Issues**: Latency and partitioning can affect performance and consistency.
  - **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across nodes can be challenging.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Simple distributed system architecture
Client -> Load Balancer -> [Server1, Server2, Server3]
# Each server handles part of the workload, sharing the load and providing redundancy.
```

## Real-world Applications
- **Google Search**: Uses distributed systems to index and search vast amounts of web data.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Provides cloud services using distributed systems for scalability and reliability.
- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
