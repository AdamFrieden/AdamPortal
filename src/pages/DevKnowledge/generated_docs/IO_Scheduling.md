# I/O Scheduling

> I/O Scheduling is a critical component of operating systems, optimizing the order in which input/output operations are executed to enhance system performance and responsiveness.

## Core idea
- **Purpose**: I/O scheduling manages the order of I/O operations to minimize wait time and maximize throughput.
- **Efficiency**: It reduces seek time on disk drives, which is crucial for performance, especially in systems with high I/O demand.
- **Fairness**: Ensures equitable resource distribution among processes, preventing any single process from monopolizing I/O resources.
- **Adaptability**: Different algorithms cater to various workload characteristics, from real-time systems to general-purpose computing.

## Key features
- **Algorithm Variety**: Includes First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), Elevator (SCAN), and Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ), each with unique trade-offs.
- **Prioritization**: Some algorithms prioritize certain types of I/O requests, such as read over write, to optimize performance.
- **Latency Reduction**: By reordering requests, I/O scheduling can significantly reduce latency, especially in disk-based systems.
- **Resource Utilization**: Enhances the overall utilization of I/O devices, leading to improved system throughput.

## Why / When / How
- **Why**: To improve system performance by reducing I/O wait times and ensuring fair resource allocation.
- **When**: Essential in environments with high I/O demands, such as databases, file servers, and virtualized systems.
- **How**: Choose the appropriate scheduling algorithm based on workload characteristics and system requirements.
- **Pitfalls**: Overhead from complex algorithms can negate benefits in low-demand environments; inappropriate algorithm choice can lead to increased latency or starvation.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Example of Elevator (SCAN) Algorithm
requests = [98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67]
current_position = 53
direction = "up"

# Sort requests
requests.sort()

# Process requests in the current direction
if direction == "up":
    for request in requests:
        if request >= current_position:
            process(request)

# Reverse direction at the end
for request in reversed(requests):
    if request < current_position:
        process(request)
```

## Real-world applications
- **Databases**: Optimizing I/O operations for faster query processing and data retrieval.
- **Virtual Machines**: Balancing I/O load across multiple VMs to ensure consistent performance.
- **Cloud Storage**: Enhancing the efficiency of large-scale storage systems by optimizing disk access patterns.
