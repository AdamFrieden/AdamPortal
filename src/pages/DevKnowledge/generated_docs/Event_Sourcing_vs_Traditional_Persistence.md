# Event Sourcing vs Traditional Persistence

> **Takeaway**: Event Sourcing and Traditional Persistence represent two distinct approaches to data storage and management. Event Sourcing captures all changes as a sequence of events, while Traditional Persistence focuses on storing the current state of data. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs, making them suitable for different scenarios.

## Core Idea
- **Event Sourcing**:
  - Captures all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
  - Events are immutable and stored in an append-only log.
  - The current state is derived by replaying these events.
  - Facilitates auditability, traceability, and debugging by maintaining a complete history.
  
- **Traditional Persistence**:
  - Stores the current state of data, typically in a relational database.
  - Changes overwrite previous states, losing historical context.
  - Simpler to implement and understand for straightforward CRUD operations.

## Key Features
- **Event Sourcing**:
  - **Auditability**: Complete history of changes is preserved.
  - **Scalability**: Can efficiently handle high-throughput systems.
  - **Flexibility**: Enables retroactive changes and temporal queries.
  
- **Traditional Persistence**:
  - **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and maintain for simple applications.
  - **Maturity**: Supported by a wide range of tools and technologies.
  - **Performance**: Optimized for quick read and write operations on current state.

## Why / When / How
- **Event Sourcing**:
  - **When to Use**: Suitable for complex domains requiring audit trails, such as financial systems or event-driven architectures.
  - **Common Pitfalls**: Complexity in event schema evolution, potential performance overhead in event replay, and increased storage requirements.
  
- **Traditional Persistence**:
  - **When to Use**: Ideal for applications with straightforward data requirements and minimal need for historical data.
  - **Common Pitfalls**: Lack of historical data can be a limitation for audit and debugging purposes.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Event Sourcing Example
eventStore.append(Event(userId, "UserCreated", {name: "Alice"}))
eventStore.append(Event(userId, "UserUpdated", {name: "Alice Smith"}))

# Reconstructing state
state = {}
for event in eventStore.getEvents(userId):
    apply(event, state)
```

## Real-world Applications
- **Event Sourcing**: Used by systems like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and in platforms like Apache Kafka for event-driven architectures.
- **Traditional Persistence**: Common in web applications using ORM frameworks like Hibernate or Django ORM.
