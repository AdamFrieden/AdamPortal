# Stateless Services

> Stateless services process requests independently, without retaining client session data between requests.

## Overview
Stateless services are designed to handle each client request as an independent transaction, without relying on stored session data. This architecture simplifies scaling and enhances reliability by eliminating the need for session management.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Each request contains all the information necessary for the service to process it.
- The service does not store any state between requests, making it inherently scalable and fault-tolerant.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Scalability**: Easily scale horizontally by adding more instances without session synchronization.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Instances can be replaced or restarted without affecting ongoing sessions.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces complexity by eliminating session management logic.
- **Load Balancing**: Requests can be distributed to any instance, enhancing resource utilization.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **State Management**: Requires external mechanisms (e.g., databases, caches) to manage state if needed.
- **Complexity in Stateful Operations**: Not suitable for operations that inherently require session state.
- **Latency**: Potentially increased latency due to repeated data retrieval for each request.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: Building scalable, resilient services where each request can be processed independently.
- **Avoid When**: Applications require complex session management or stateful interactions.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: RESTful APIs, microservices architectures.
- **Alternatives**: Stateful services, serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Stateless services cannot handle complex transactions.
- **Reality**: They can, but require external state management solutions.
