# Monolith vs Microservices

> Monoliths are unified systems; microservices are modular, independently deployable components.

## Overview
Monolithic architecture is a single, unified software system where all components are interconnected and interdependent. Microservices architecture breaks down applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. These architectures exist to address different needs in scalability, maintainability, and deployment.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Monolith**: A single, cohesive unit where all parts are tightly coupled.
- **Microservices**: A collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific function.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Monolith**:
  - Easier to develop and test initially.
  - Simpler deployment process.
  - Unified codebase can simplify debugging.
- **Microservices**:
  - Scalability: Services can be scaled independently.
  - Flexibility: Technology stack can vary per service.
  - Resilience: Failure in one service doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Monolith**:
  - Can become unwieldy and difficult to maintain as it grows.
  - Scaling requires scaling the entire application.
- **Microservices**:
  - Increased complexity in deployment and management.
  - Requires robust inter-service communication and data consistency strategies.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use Monolith**:
  - For small teams or projects with limited scope.
  - When rapid initial development is a priority.
- **Use Microservices**:
  - For large, complex applications requiring scalability.
  - When different teams manage different parts of the application.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Monolith**: Traditional enterprise applications, early-stage startups.
- **Microservices**: Netflix, Amazon, Uber.
- **Alternatives**: Serverless architecture, modular monoliths.

## Common Misconceptions
- Microservices are always better than monoliths.
- Monoliths cannot scale.
- Microservices eliminate all technical debt.
