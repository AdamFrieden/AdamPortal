# Load Testing

> Load testing evaluates system performance under expected user loads to ensure reliability and scalability.

## Overview
Load testing is a type of performance testing that simulates real-world load conditions to assess how a system behaves under expected and peak user loads. It exists to identify bottlenecks, ensure stability, and verify that the system can handle anticipated traffic without degradation.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Simulate user activity to measure system performance under typical and peak conditions.
- Identify performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Scalability Assessment**: Ensures systems can scale to meet user demands.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establishes baseline performance metrics.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Detects performance issues and resource constraints.
- **Reliability Assurance**: Validates system stability under load.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires significant setup and resources to simulate realistic loads.
- **Complex Analysis**: Interpreting results can be complex and requires expertise.
- **Overlooked Scenarios**: May not cover all real-world scenarios, leading to gaps in testing.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: Before major releases, during infrastructure changes, or when scaling up.
- **Avoid**: When lacking resources or expertise to conduct meaningful tests.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner.
- **Services**: AWS Load Testing, Azure Load Testing.
- **Alternatives**: Stress testing, which tests beyond normal operational capacity.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"Load testing is the same as stress testing."**: Load testing focuses on expected loads, while stress testing pushes beyond limits.
- **"Load testing guarantees no downtime."**: It reduces risk but doesn't eliminate it entirely.
