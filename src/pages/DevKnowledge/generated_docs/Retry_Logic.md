# Retry Logic

> Retry logic is a strategy to handle transient failures by attempting an operation multiple times before failing.

## Overview
Retry logic is a programming technique used to automatically reattempt an operation that has failed due to temporary issues, such as network timeouts or service unavailability. It exists to improve the resilience and reliability of systems by mitigating the impact of transient failures.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Retry logic assumes that some failures are temporary and can be resolved by simply trying the operation again after a short delay.
- It involves defining a retry policy, which includes the number of attempts, delay between attempts, and conditions for retrying.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Resilience**: Increases system robustness by handling transient errors gracefully.
- **Simplicity**: Provides a straightforward mechanism to deal with temporary failures without complex error handling.
- **Configurability**: Allows customization of retry strategies to suit specific application needs.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Resource Consumption**: Excessive retries can lead to resource exhaustion and increased latency.
- **Complexity**: Poorly designed retry logic can introduce complexity and obscure the root cause of failures.
- **Ineffectiveness**: Not all failures are transient; retrying may not resolve persistent issues.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When dealing with operations prone to transient failures, such as network requests or database connections.
- **Avoid**: For operations where failures are likely to be persistent or indicative of a deeper issue.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Libraries like Polly for .NET, Resilience4j for Java, and Tenacity for Python implement retry logic.
- **Alternatives**: Circuit breakers, exponential backoff strategies, and idempotency keys can complement or replace retry logic.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Retry logic can fix all types of failures.
- **Reality**: It only addresses transient issues and is not a substitute for proper error handling.
