# Memcached

> Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, designed to speed up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

## Overview
Memcached is an open-source, in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. It exists to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the load on databases and speeding up data retrieval.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Memcached acts as a short-term memory for your applications, storing frequently accessed data in RAM to reduce latency and database load.
- It uses a simple key-value storage model, making it easy to implement and scale horizontally.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **High Performance**: Provides sub-millisecond response times due to its in-memory nature.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **Simplicity**: Offers a straightforward API for storing and retrieving data.
- **Language Agnostic**: Supports multiple programming languages through various client libraries.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Volatile Storage**: Data is stored in RAM and is lost on server restarts or crashes.
- **Limited Data Persistence**: Not suitable for long-term storage or complex queries.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Requires careful management to ensure data consistency.
- **Memory Overhead**: Inefficient use of memory for small datasets due to its slab allocation mechanism.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need to cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve application response times.
- **Avoid**: For storing critical data that requires persistence or when complex querying capabilities are needed.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Facebook uses Memcached to handle billions of requests per second.
- **Alternatives**: Redis (offers persistence and more data structures), Varnish (HTTP accelerator).

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Memcached can be used as a primary data store.
- **Reality**: It is designed for caching, not as a primary database.
