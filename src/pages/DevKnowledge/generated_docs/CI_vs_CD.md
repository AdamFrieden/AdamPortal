# CI vs CD

> CI/CD streamlines software delivery by automating integration and deployment, enhancing speed and reliability.

## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are methodologies in software development that automate the integration and deployment processes. CI focuses on integrating code changes frequently, while CD automates the deployment of code to production environments. These practices aim to reduce integration issues, improve code quality, and accelerate delivery cycles.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **CI**: Automate the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository, ensuring early detection of integration issues.
- **CD**: Automate the deployment process, ensuring that code changes are delivered to production reliably and quickly.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **CI**:
  - Early detection of bugs through automated testing.
  - Reduced integration issues by merging changes frequently.
  - Improved collaboration among developers.
- **CD**:
  - Faster time-to-market with automated deployments.
  - Consistent and reliable release processes.
  - Reduced manual intervention, minimizing human error.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **CI**:
  - Requires investment in automated testing infrastructure.
  - Can lead to integration bottlenecks if not managed properly.
- **CD**:
  - Demands robust testing and monitoring to avoid deploying faulty code.
  - May require cultural shifts towards more frequent releases.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**:
  - When aiming to improve release frequency and reliability.
  - In environments with frequent code changes and multiple contributors.
- **Avoid**:
  - In highly regulated industries without proper compliance checks.
  - When lacking resources for adequate testing and monitoring.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI.
- **Alternatives**: Feature flagging, canary releases, blue-green deployments.

## Common Misconceptions
- CI/CD is only for large teams: It benefits teams of all sizes.
- CD always means Continuous Deployment: It can also mean Continuous Delivery, where deployments are manual.
