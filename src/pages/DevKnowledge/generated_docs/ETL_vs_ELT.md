# ETL vs ELT

> ETL and ELT are data processing paradigms that differ in the sequence of data transformation and loading.

## Overview
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are data integration processes used to move data from source systems to a data warehouse or data lake. ETL transforms data before loading it into the target system, while ELT loads raw data first and transforms it within the target system. These processes exist to enable efficient data analysis and reporting.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **ETL**: Transform data in a staging area before loading it into the data warehouse.
- **ELT**: Load raw data into the data warehouse and perform transformations there, leveraging the power of modern data processing engines.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **ETL**:
  - Suitable for structured data and traditional data warehouses.
  - Ensures data quality and consistency before loading.
- **ELT**:
  - Leverages scalable cloud-based data warehouses.
  - Handles large volumes of data efficiently.
  - Allows for more flexible and iterative data transformations.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **ETL**:
  - Can be slower due to pre-loading transformations.
  - May require more complex data pipelines.
- **ELT**:
  - Requires robust data governance to manage raw data.
  - Potentially higher storage costs due to loading unprocessed data.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use ETL** when dealing with legacy systems or when data quality must be assured before loading.
- **Use ELT** for cloud-native environments with large data volumes and when leveraging powerful data processing capabilities of modern data warehouses.
- **Avoid ETL** if transformation speed is critical and data volume is high.
- **Avoid ELT** if the target system lacks the capability to efficiently process transformations.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **ETL Tools**: Informatica, Talend
- **ELT Tools**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon Redshift
- **Alternatives**: Data virtualization, stream processing with Apache Kafka

## Common Misconceptions
- ELT is not inherently better than ETL; choice depends on context.
- ETL is not obsolete; it remains relevant for specific use cases.
