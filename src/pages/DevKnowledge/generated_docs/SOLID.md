# SOLID

> SOLID is a set of five principles for designing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software.

## Overview
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely adopted in object-oriented programming to improve software quality and facilitate agile development.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## Key Features & Benefits
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- Facilitates easier refactoring and scaling.
- Encourages the use of interfaces and abstract classes.
- Promotes loose coupling and high cohesion.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- Over-engineering: Applying SOLID principles unnecessarily can lead to complex designs.
- Misinterpretation: Misapplying principles can result in rigid and hard-to-maintain code.
- Increased upfront design time.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use:** When designing complex systems that require long-term maintenance and scalability.
- **Avoid:** In small, simple projects where the overhead of applying SOLID outweighs the benefits.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples:** Design patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Observer embody SOLID principles.
- **Alternatives:** Functional programming paradigms, which emphasize immutability and pure functions, offer different approaches to software design.

## Common Misconceptions
- SOLID is not a silver bullet; it requires thoughtful application.
- Not all five principles need to be applied simultaneously.
