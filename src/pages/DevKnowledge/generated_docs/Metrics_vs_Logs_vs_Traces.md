# Metrics vs Logs vs Traces

> Metrics, logs, and traces are essential observability tools that provide different insights into system performance and behavior.

## Overview
Metrics, logs, and traces are foundational components of observability in software systems. They exist to help engineers monitor, diagnose, and optimize applications by providing different perspectives on system behavior and performance.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Metrics**: Quantitative data points that measure system performance over time (e.g., CPU usage, request count).
- **Logs**: Detailed, timestamped records of discrete events within a system (e.g., error messages, user actions).
- **Traces**: End-to-end records of a request's journey through a distributed system, capturing latency and path.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Metrics**:
  - Efficient storage and retrieval for time-series data.
  - Ideal for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- **Logs**:
  - Rich context for debugging and auditing.
  - Flexible querying for detailed analysis.
- **Traces**:
  - Visualize request paths and identify bottlenecks.
  - Essential for understanding complex, distributed systems.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Metrics**:
  - Limited context; may not explain why an anomaly occurred.
- **Logs**:
  - Can become voluminous and costly to store.
  - May require significant parsing and analysis effort.
- **Traces**:
  - Overhead in instrumentation and data collection.
  - Complexity in managing trace data at scale.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use Metrics** for monitoring system health and performance trends.
- **Use Logs** for detailed troubleshooting and forensic analysis.
- **Use Traces** for diagnosing latency issues in distributed systems.
- **Avoid Metrics** when detailed context is needed.
- **Avoid Logs** when storage costs are prohibitive.
- **Avoid Traces** if system complexity does not justify the overhead.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Datadog
- **Logs**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk
- **Traces**: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry

## Common Misconceptions
- Metrics, logs, and traces are interchangeable.
- Traces are only useful for microservices.
- Logs are always the best choice for debugging.
