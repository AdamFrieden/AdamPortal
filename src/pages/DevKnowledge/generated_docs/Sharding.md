# Sharding

> Sharding is a database partitioning technique that distributes data across multiple servers to improve scalability and performance.

## Overview
Sharding is a method of splitting a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards." Each shard is stored on a separate database server, allowing for horizontal scaling. This technique is essential for applications that experience high traffic and require efficient data management.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Divide and conquer: Split data into shards based on a sharding key, distributing them across multiple servers to balance load and improve performance.
- Each shard operates independently, allowing for parallel processing and reduced contention.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Scalability**: Easily add more servers to handle increased load.
- **Performance**: Distributes queries across shards, reducing latency and improving response times.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Isolates failures to individual shards, minimizing impact on the overall system.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Requires careful design and management of sharding keys and data distribution.
- **Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across shards can be challenging.
- **Operational Overhead**: Increases complexity in backup, recovery, and schema changes.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When dealing with large-scale applications with high read/write demands that exceed the capacity of a single database server.
- **Avoid**: For small to medium-sized applications where a single database server can handle the load efficiently.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, and MySQL with custom sharding solutions.
- **Alternatives**: Database replication, partitioning, or using distributed databases like Amazon DynamoDB.

## Common Misconceptions
- Sharding is not a silver bullet; it doesn't automatically solve all scaling issues.
- Sharding is not the same as replication; it focuses on distributing data, not duplicating it.
