# Backpressure

> Backpressure is a flow-control mechanism that prevents system overload by balancing data production and consumption rates.

## Overview
Backpressure is a strategy used in software systems to manage the flow of data between producers and consumers. It exists to prevent system overload by ensuring that data producers do not overwhelm consumers with more data than they can handle.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Backpressure acts as a feedback loop, signaling producers to slow down when consumers are at capacity.
- It ensures system stability by maintaining a balance between data input and processing capabilities.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Prevents Overload**: Protects systems from crashing due to excessive data input.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes resource usage by aligning production rates with processing capabilities.
- **Improved Reliability**: Enhances system reliability by reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Increased Latency**: Introducing backpressure can lead to increased latency as data flow is regulated.
- **Complexity**: Implementing backpressure can add complexity to system design and maintenance.
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: Misconfigured backpressure can create bottlenecks, hindering performance.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: Systems experience frequent overloads, data loss, or require high reliability.
- **Avoid When**: Systems have low data volume or when latency is a critical concern.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Reactive Streams**: A specification for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure.
- **Apache Kafka**: Utilizes backpressure to manage message flow between producers and consumers.
- **Alternatives**: Consider load balancing or rate limiting as simpler alternatives for some use cases.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Backpressure eliminates all latency issues.
- **Myth**: It is only relevant for high-throughput systems.
