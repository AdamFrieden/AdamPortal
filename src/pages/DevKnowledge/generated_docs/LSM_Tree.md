# 🌲 LSM Tree

✅ **A Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM Tree) is a data structure designed to handle high write throughput and large-scale data efficiently.**

### 🧠 Core idea:
- LSM Trees optimize write operations by initially writing data to a memory-resident table and periodically merging it into disk-based tables.
- They balance read and write performance through multi-level data compaction and merging strategies.

### 📦 Key features:
- High write throughput by buffering writes in memory.
- Efficient compaction strategies to merge and sort data periodically.
- Reduced write amplification compared to traditional B-trees.

### 🔍 Example:
- Imagine a database receiving continuous write requests: LSM Trees first store these writes in a fast in-memory structure and later merge them with existing data on disk, minimizing immediate disk I/O.

### 📊 Comparison:
- Compared to B-trees: LSM Trees offer better write performance due to reduced disk I/O but may have higher read latency due to data spread across multiple levels.
- Compared to Hash Tables: LSM Trees support range queries and sorted data, unlike hash tables that excel in point queries.

### 🚀 Real-world applications:
- Used in NoSQL databases like Cassandra and HBase for handling large volumes of write operations.
- Employed in time-series databases for efficient data ingestion and retrieval.
- Utilized in log management systems to manage and query large log files efficiently.
