# IAM Roles

> IAM Roles provide temporary, fine-grained permissions to AWS resources, enhancing security and flexibility.

## Overview
IAM Roles are a feature of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that allow you to delegate access to AWS resources without sharing long-term credentials. They exist to enable secure, temporary access to resources for users, applications, or services that need it.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- IAM Roles act as a set of permissions that can be assumed by trusted entities, granting them temporary access to AWS resources.
- They decouple identity from permissions, allowing for more secure and manageable access control.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Temporary Credentials**: Provides short-lived access, reducing the risk of credential leakage.
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Allows precise control over what actions can be performed on which resources.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Facilitates secure access to resources across different AWS accounts.
- **Service Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS services, enabling secure service-to-service communication.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Misconfiguration can lead to overly permissive roles or access issues.
- **Limited to AWS**: IAM Roles are specific to AWS, which may not be suitable for multi-cloud environments.
- **Role Chaining Limits**: AWS imposes limits on the number of role assumptions, which can complicate complex workflows.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use when**: You need secure, temporary access to AWS resources, especially for applications or services.
- **Avoid when**: You require long-term credentials or are operating in a multi-cloud environment without AWS as the primary provider.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **AWS Lambda**: Uses IAM Roles to access other AWS services securely.
- **ECS Task Roles**: Provide permissions to containers running on AWS ECS.
- **Alternatives**: Consider using Azure Managed Identities or Google Cloud IAM for similar functionality in other cloud environments.

## Common Misconceptions
- **IAM Roles are not user accounts**: They do not have passwords or long-term credentials.
- **Roles do not automatically grant access**: They must be explicitly assumed by a trusted entity.
