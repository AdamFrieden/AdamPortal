# Algorithms vs Design Patterns

> Algorithms solve specific problems; design patterns provide reusable solutions to common design challenges.

## Overview
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Both exist to improve efficiency and maintainability in software development.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Algorithms**: Focus on the "how" of solving a specific problem.
- **Design Patterns**: Focus on the "what" and "why" of structuring code to solve recurring design problems.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Algorithms**:
  - Provide precise solutions to computational problems.
  - Optimize performance and resource usage.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - Enhance code readability and maintainability.
  - Facilitate communication among developers through a shared vocabulary.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Algorithms**:
  - Can be complex and hard to implement correctly.
  - May require significant optimization for specific use cases.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - Overuse can lead to unnecessary complexity.
  - Misapplication can result in inefficient or inappropriate designs.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use Algorithms** when you need to solve a specific computational problem efficiently.
- **Use Design Patterns** when you need to address a recurring design issue in a scalable and maintainable way.
- **Avoid Algorithms** if the problem is trivial or performance is not a concern.
- **Avoid Design Patterns** if they add unnecessary complexity or do not fit the problem context.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort), search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search).
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Observer, Factory.
- **Modern Alternatives**: Functional programming paradigms, microservices architecture.

## Common Misconceptions
- Algorithms and design patterns are not interchangeable; they serve different purposes.
- Design patterns are not one-size-fits-all solutions; they require contextual adaptation.
