# API Rate Limiting

> API Rate Limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to a server within a specified timeframe.

## Overview
API Rate Limiting is a technique used to manage the amount of incoming traffic to a server by restricting the number of requests a client can make in a given period. It exists to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain the stability and performance of the server.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Think of rate limiting as a traffic cop for your API, ensuring no single client overwhelms the system.
- It enforces a balance between resource availability and demand.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Prevents Abuse**: Protects against denial-of-service attacks and resource hogging.
- **Ensures Fair Usage**: Guarantees equitable access for all users.
- **Enhances Stability**: Maintains server performance by avoiding overload.
- **Improves User Experience**: By preventing server crashes, it ensures consistent service availability.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Implementing rate limiting can add complexity to your API infrastructure.
- **User Frustration**: If limits are too strict, legitimate users may be unfairly restricted.
- **Latency**: Rate limiting checks can introduce additional latency.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: You need to protect your API from abuse, ensure fair resource allocation, or maintain system stability.
- **Avoid When**: Your API is internal with trusted clients, or when performance overhead is a critical concern.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: NGINX, AWS API Gateway, and Cloudflare offer built-in rate limiting features.
- **Alternatives**: Token bucket algorithms, leaky bucket algorithms, and circuit breakers.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Rate limiting is only for public APIs.  
  **Fact**: It can be beneficial for internal APIs to prevent accidental misuse.
- **Myth**: Rate limiting alone can secure an API.  
  **Fact**: It should be part of a broader security strategy.
