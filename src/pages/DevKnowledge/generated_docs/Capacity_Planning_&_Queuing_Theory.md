# Capacity Planning & Queuing Theory

> Capacity Planning and Queuing Theory are essential for designing systems that efficiently handle varying loads and ensure optimal performance. They help in predicting system behavior under different conditions, thus aiding in resource allocation and performance tuning.

## Core idea
- **Capacity Planning** involves determining the necessary resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to meet expected demand without over-provisioning.
- **Queuing Theory** provides mathematical models to analyze the behavior of queues, helping predict wait times and system throughput.
- Both are crucial for ensuring system reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Key features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate future resource needs based on historical data and trends.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.
- **Cost Management**: Avoid over-provisioning while ensuring adequate resources to handle peak loads.
- **Scalability**: Design systems that can scale efficiently with demand.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Ensure compliance with performance and availability commitments.

## Why / When / How
- **Why**: To ensure systems can handle expected loads efficiently, maintain performance, and control costs.
- **When**: During system design, before major deployments, or when experiencing performance issues.
- **How**: Use historical data, simulations, and queuing models to predict system behavior and plan resources.
- **Pitfalls**: Over-reliance on static models can lead to inaccuracies; dynamic and real-time monitoring is crucial. Avoid assumptions that do not account for variability in demand.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Example of a simple M/M/1 queue model
# M/M/1: Single server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times

arrival_rate = 10  # requests per second
service_rate = 15  # requests per second

# Utilization factor (œÅ)
utilization = arrival_rate / service_rate

# Average number of items in the system (L)
L = utilization / (1 - utilization)

# Average time an item spends in the system (W)
W = L / arrival_rate

print("Utilization:", utilization)
print("Average number in system:", L)
print("Average time in system:", W)
```

## Real-world applications
- **Web Servers**: Ensuring web servers can handle peak traffic without degradation.
- **Cloud Services**: Dynamic scaling of resources based on demand patterns.
- **Telecommunications**: Managing call centers and network traffic to minimize wait times and dropped calls.
- **Manufacturing**: Optimizing production lines to balance workload and reduce idle time.
