# Caching & Performance

> Caching is a critical technique for enhancing application performance by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed storage layer. It reduces latency and load on primary data sources, leading to faster response times and improved user experience.

## Core idea
- **Definition**: Caching involves storing copies of data in a temporary storage location to quickly retrieve it without accessing the slower underlying data source.
- **Purpose**: The primary goal is to reduce data retrieval time, decrease load on backend systems, and improve application scalability.
- **Types**: Common caching strategies include in-memory caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached), disk-based caching, and distributed caching.

## Key features
- **Speed**: Caches provide faster data retrieval compared to databases or other persistent storage.
- **Scalability**: By offloading requests from the primary data source, caching helps systems handle more concurrent users.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for expensive compute resources by minimizing database queries and network calls.
- **Flexibility**: Can be implemented at various levels, including client-side, server-side, or as a dedicated caching layer.

## Why / When / How
- **When to Use**: Ideal for read-heavy workloads, repetitive data access patterns, and scenarios where low latency is critical.
- **How to Implement**: Choose the right caching strategy based on data volatility, access patterns, and consistency requirements.
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - **Stale Data**: Cached data may become outdated; implement cache invalidation strategies.
  - **Cache Misses**: Occur when requested data is not in the cache, leading to potential performance degradation.
  - **Overhead**: Improper cache configuration can lead to increased memory usage and maintenance complexity.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudo-code for caching a database query result
cache_key = "user_profile_123"
cached_data = cache.get(cache_key)

if cached_data is None:
    # Cache miss, fetch from database
    user_profile = database.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123")
    cache.set(cache_key, user_profile, ttl=3600)  # Cache for 1 hour
else:
    # Cache hit, use cached data
    user_profile = cached_data

return user_profile
```

## Real-world applications
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Use caching to deliver web content closer to users, reducing latency.
- **Web Applications**: Cache session data, user profiles, and frequently accessed resources to improve response times.
- **Database Query Caching**: Reduce load on databases by caching query results for repeated access.
