# AWS EventBridge

> AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that enables event-driven architectures by connecting applications using events.

## Overview
AWS EventBridge is a fully managed event bus service that facilitates the building of event-driven architectures. It allows applications to communicate through events, decoupling the producers and consumers of data. This service is designed to simplify the process of building scalable, event-driven applications by providing a central hub for event routing.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- EventBridge acts as a central event bus that routes events from sources (e.g., AWS services, custom applications) to targets (e.g., AWS Lambda, Step Functions).
- It enables loose coupling between services, allowing them to operate independently and scale efficiently.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage, automatically scales with demand.
- **Event Filtering**: Fine-grained filtering rules to ensure only relevant events are routed to targets.
- **Schema Registry**: Automatically discovers and stores event schemas, simplifying event validation and transformation.
- **Cross-Account Events**: Supports event sharing across AWS accounts, facilitating multi-account architectures.
- **Integration with AWS Services**: Seamless integration with a wide range of AWS services and third-party SaaS applications.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Latency**: EventBridge may introduce latency compared to direct service-to-service communication.
- **Complexity**: Designing event-driven architectures can be complex, requiring careful planning of event flows and dependencies.
- **Cost**: While serverless, costs can accumulate with high event volumes or complex event processing.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When building decoupled, scalable applications that benefit from event-driven architectures.
- **Avoid**: For simple, low-latency applications where direct communication is more efficient.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Real-time data processing, microservices communication, automated workflows.
- **Alternatives**: Apache Kafka, AWS SNS/SQS, Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: EventBridge is only for AWS services.  
  **Fact**: It supports custom applications and third-party integrations.
- **Myth**: EventBridge is a replacement for all messaging services.  
  **Fact**: It complements other services like SQS and SNS, each serving different use cases.
