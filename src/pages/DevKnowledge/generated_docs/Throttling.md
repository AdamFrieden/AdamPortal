# Throttling

> Throttling controls the rate of requests to a system, ensuring stability and preventing overload.

## Overview
Throttling is a technique used to regulate the flow of requests to a system, preventing it from being overwhelmed by excessive demand. It exists to maintain system performance, ensure fair resource allocation, and protect against denial-of-service attacks.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Throttling acts as a traffic cop, managing the flow of requests to maintain system stability.
- It enforces limits on the number of requests a user or service can make in a given timeframe.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the number of requests per user or service.
- **Load Management**: Helps maintain optimal system performance under high load.
- **Fairness**: Ensures equitable resource distribution among users.
- **Security**: Protects against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **User Experience**: Overly aggressive throttling can degrade user experience.
- **Complexity**: Implementing throttling can add complexity to system design.
- **Latency**: May introduce delays if not properly configured.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When facing unpredictable traffic spikes, to prevent system overload, or to enforce fair usage policies.
- **Avoid**: In low-traffic environments where the overhead of throttling outweighs its benefits.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **APIs**: Many APIs implement throttling to manage client requests.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer built-in throttling mechanisms.
- **Alternatives**: Circuit breakers and load balancers can complement or replace throttling in some scenarios.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Throttling is not the same as rate limiting**: Rate limiting is a specific form of throttling.
- **Throttling does not eliminate the need for scaling**: It complements scaling strategies, not replaces them.
