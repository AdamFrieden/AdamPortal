# Automated Rollbacks & Roll forwards

> Automated rollbacks and roll forwards are essential strategies in modern software deployment, enabling rapid recovery from failures and seamless updates, thus ensuring system stability and minimizing downtime.

## Core idea
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Automatically revert a system to a previous stable state after a failed deployment, minimizing downtime and reducing manual intervention.
- **Roll forwards**: Quickly move forward to a new stable state after a failure, often by deploying a fix or patch, ensuring continuity and improvement.
- **Importance**: These mechanisms are crucial for maintaining high availability and reliability in continuous deployment environments.

## Key features
- **Speed and Efficiency**: Automated processes reduce the time taken to recover from failures, enhancing system uptime.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that rollbacks and roll forwards are performed in a consistent manner, reducing human error.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Seamlessly integrates with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for smooth operations.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Often includes monitoring tools to detect failures and trigger rollbacks or roll forwards automatically.

## Why / When / How
- **Why**: To ensure system reliability and minimize downtime during deployments.
- **When**: Use during any deployment process where the risk of failure is non-negligible, especially in production environments.
- **How**: Implement using version control systems, deployment scripts, and CI/CD tools that support automated rollback and roll forward capabilities.
- **Pitfalls**: Avoid using automated rollbacks in scenarios where data consistency might be compromised or where complex stateful transactions are involved.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudo-code for an automated rollback process
if deployment_status == "failed":
    trigger_rollback()
    notify_team("Deployment failed, rollback initiated.")

# Pseudo-code for an automated roll forward process
if issue_fixed:
    trigger_roll_forward()
    notify_team("Issue resolved, roll forward initiated.")
```

## Real-world applications
- **Kubernetes**: Utilizes rolling updates and rollbacks to manage application deployments efficiently.
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Offers automated rollback capabilities to previous versions if a deployment fails.
- **GitOps**: Practices often include automated rollback and roll forward strategies to maintain desired state configurations.
