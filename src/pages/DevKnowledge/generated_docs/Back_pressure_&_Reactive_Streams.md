# Back Pressure & Reactive Streams

> Back pressure and Reactive Streams are essential for managing data flow in asynchronous systems, ensuring stability and efficiency by preventing data overload.

## Core Idea
- **Back Pressure**: A mechanism to control the flow of data between producers and consumers, preventing the latter from being overwhelmed by too much data.
- **Reactive Streams**: A standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure, enabling systems to handle data flow efficiently.
- **Importance**: Ensures system stability by matching data production rates with consumption capabilities, reducing resource exhaustion and latency.

## Key Features
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Allows systems to handle data without blocking, improving throughput and responsiveness.
- **Non-blocking Back Pressure**: Dynamically adjusts data flow rates, preventing buffer overflows and resource saturation.
- **Interoperability**: Provides a common API for different reactive libraries, facilitating integration and consistency across systems.
- **Scalability**: Supports high-throughput systems by efficiently managing resources and data flow.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use It**: To maintain system stability and performance in environments with variable data rates and processing capabilities.
- **When to Use It**: Ideal for microservices, streaming data applications, and systems with unpredictable data loads.
- **How to Implement**: Utilize libraries like Project Reactor, Akka Streams, or RxJava that adhere to the Reactive Streams specification.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoid using in simple, low-throughput applications where the overhead of reactive systems may outweigh benefits. Ensure proper understanding of back pressure mechanisms to prevent misconfiguration.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudo-code for a simple reactive stream with back pressure
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

publisher.subscribe(subscriber);

class Subscriber {
    onSubscribe(subscription) {
        subscription.request(10); // Request 10 items at a time
    }
    
    onNext(item) {
        process(item);
        if (needMoreItems()) {
            subscription.request(10); // Request more items as needed
        }
    }
    
    onError(error) {
        handleError(error);
    }
    
    onComplete() {
        completeProcessing();
    }
}
```

## Real-world Applications
- **Netflix**: Uses reactive streams to manage data flow in its microservices architecture, ensuring smooth video streaming.
- **Twitter**: Employs back pressure in its event processing systems to handle high volumes of tweets and interactions efficiently.
- **Spring WebFlux**: A part of the Spring Framework, it uses reactive streams to build non-blocking web applications.
