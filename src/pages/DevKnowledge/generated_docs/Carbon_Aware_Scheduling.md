# Carbon Aware Scheduling

> Carbon Aware Scheduling optimizes computing tasks to align with periods of lower carbon intensity in the energy grid, reducing the carbon footprint of IT operations.

## Core idea
- **Objective**: Reduce carbon emissions by scheduling computational tasks during times when renewable energy sources are more prevalent in the energy grid.
- **Importance**: As data centers and cloud services consume significant energy, aligning their operations with cleaner energy periods can substantially lower carbon emissions.
- **Mechanism**: Utilizes real-time data on energy grid carbon intensity to make informed scheduling decisions.

## Key features
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Adjusts task execution times based on real-time carbon intensity data.
- **Integration with Grid Data**: Interfaces with energy grid APIs to obtain current and forecasted carbon intensity.
- **Scalability**: Applicable to various scales, from individual data centers to global cloud operations.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially reduces energy costs by leveraging off-peak periods, which often coincide with lower carbon intensity.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use It**: To minimize the environmental impact of IT operations and align with corporate sustainability goals.
- **When to Use It**: Ideal for non-time-sensitive tasks, batch processing, and workloads that can tolerate flexible execution times.
- **How to Implement**: Integrate with energy grid APIs, adjust scheduling algorithms to consider carbon intensity, and ensure compliance with operational constraints.
- **Pitfalls**: Not suitable for latency-sensitive applications or tasks requiring immediate execution. Requires reliable carbon intensity data and may involve complex integration.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudocode for Carbon Aware Scheduling
while true:
    carbon_intensity = get_current_carbon_intensity()
    if carbon_intensity < threshold:
        execute_scheduled_tasks()
    else:
        delay_tasks()
    wait_for_next_check_interval()
```

## Real-world applications
- **Cloud Providers**: Companies like Google and Microsoft are exploring carbon-aware computing to optimize their data center operations.
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale data processing tasks in industries like finance and genomics can be scheduled during low-carbon periods.
- **IoT and Edge Computing**: Devices can defer non-critical updates or data processing to align with greener energy availability.
