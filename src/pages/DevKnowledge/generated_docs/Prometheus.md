# Prometheus

> Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.

## Overview
Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system originally developed at SoundCloud. It is designed to collect metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, evaluate rule expressions, display results, and trigger alerts if certain conditions are met. Prometheus is particularly suited for dynamic cloud environments and microservices architectures.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Pull-based metrics collection: Prometheus scrapes metrics from endpoints.
- Time-series database: Stores metrics with a timestamp, labels, and values.
- Query language (PromQL): Allows for complex queries and aggregations.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Multi-dimensional data model**: Uses labels to identify time series.
- **Flexible query language**: PromQL enables powerful data analysis.
- **Efficient storage**: Optimized for time-series data.
- **Service discovery**: Automatically discovers targets in dynamic environments.
- **Alerting**: Integrates with Alertmanager for robust alerting capabilities.
- **Visualization**: Integrates with Grafana for rich dashboards.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Limited long-term storage**: Not designed for indefinite data retention.
- **Complexity in scaling**: Requires careful architecture for high-scale environments.
- **Learning curve**: PromQL and configuration can be complex for beginners.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need a reliable, scalable monitoring solution for cloud-native applications and microservices.
- **Avoid**: If you require long-term historical data storage or need a simple, out-of-the-box solution with minimal setup.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Monitoring Kubernetes clusters, microservices architectures.
- **Alternatives**: Grafana Loki (for logs), InfluxDB (for time-series data), Datadog (commercial alternative).

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Prometheus is a logging tool.  
  **Fact**: It is primarily for metrics, not logs.
- **Myth**: Prometheus replaces all monitoring tools.  
  **Fact**: It complements other tools like logging and tracing systems.
