# ArgoCD

> ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## Overview
ArgoCD is a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool that automates the deployment of applications. It exists to streamline the process of managing application lifecycle and configuration management using Git as the source of truth.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- ArgoCD uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for defining the desired state of applications and environments.
- It continuously monitors these repositories and ensures that the live state of applications matches the desired state defined in Git.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Declarative GitOps**: Automates application deployment using Git as the source of truth.
- **Automated Syncing**: Continuously monitors and synchronizes application state with the desired state.
- **Multi-Cluster Support**: Manages applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- **User Interface**: Provides a web-based UI for visualizing application status and history.
- **Access Control**: Integrates with existing authentication systems for secure access.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: May introduce complexity in managing Git repositories and Kubernetes manifests.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of GitOps principles and Kubernetes.
- **Resource Intensive**: Can be resource-intensive, especially in large-scale environments.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need a robust, automated deployment solution for Kubernetes that leverages GitOps principles.
- **Avoid**: If your team is not familiar with GitOps or if you have a simple deployment process that doesn't require automation.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Companies using ArgoCD include Intuit and BlackRock.
- **Alternatives**: FluxCD, Jenkins X, and Spinnaker are other tools that offer similar capabilities.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"ArgoCD is only for CI"**: ArgoCD is focused on continuous delivery, not continuous integration.
- **"It replaces Kubernetes"**: ArgoCD works on top of Kubernetes, enhancing its deployment capabilities.
