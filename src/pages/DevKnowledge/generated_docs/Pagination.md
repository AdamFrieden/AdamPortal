# Pagination

> Pagination divides content into discrete pages, improving load times and user experience for large datasets.

## Overview
Pagination is a technique used to split large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. It enhances performance by reducing the amount of data loaded at once and improves user experience by making navigation through data more intuitive.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Break down large datasets into smaller, sequentially accessible pages.
- Load only the necessary data for the current view, minimizing resource consumption.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces server load and network bandwidth by fetching only a subset of data.
- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies navigation through large datasets, making it easier for users to find specific information.
- **Scalability**: Supports handling of large datasets without degrading application performance.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Implementing pagination can add complexity to both backend and frontend code.
- **State Management**: Maintaining the correct state across pages can be challenging, especially in dynamic applications.
- **SEO Considerations**: Improper pagination can negatively impact search engine optimization if not handled correctly.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: Dealing with large datasets that can overwhelm users or systems if loaded all at once.
- **Avoid When**: The dataset is small enough to be loaded and displayed efficiently in its entirety.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Libraries like `React-Paginate` for frontend pagination.
- **Services**: APIs like GraphQL support pagination through mechanisms like cursors.
- **Alternatives**: Infinite scrolling, which loads data as the user scrolls, can be used as an alternative to traditional pagination.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"Pagination is only for web apps"**: It is also applicable in APIs and database queries.
- **"Infinite scrolling is always better"**: Infinite scrolling can lead to performance issues and is not suitable for all use cases.
