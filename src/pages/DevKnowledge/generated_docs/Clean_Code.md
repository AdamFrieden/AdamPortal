# Clean Code

> Clean Code is about writing software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Overview
Clean Code refers to a set of principles and practices aimed at writing code that is clear, concise, and maintainable. It exists to improve software quality, reduce bugs, and make codebases easier to work with over time.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Code should be written for humans first, computers second.
- Prioritize readability and simplicity.
- Consistent naming conventions and structure are crucial.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Readability**: Code is easier to understand and review.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates and bug fixes.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates adding new features without degrading existing functionality.
- **Collaboration**: Enhances team productivity by reducing onboarding time.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Time Investment**: Initial development may take longer.
- **Over-engineering**: Risk of excessive abstraction or complexity.
- **Subjectivity**: What is "clean" can vary between developers.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: In long-term projects, collaborative environments, and when code longevity is critical.
- **Avoid**: In quick prototypes or throwaway scripts where speed is prioritized over quality.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Linters and formatters like ESLint, Prettier.
- **Patterns**: SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- **Alternatives**: Rapid prototyping tools for quick iterations.

## Common Misconceptions
- Clean code is not about writing less code, but clearer code.
- It is not a one-size-fits-all; context matters.
- Clean code does not mean perfect code.
