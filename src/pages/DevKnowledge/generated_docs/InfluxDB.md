# InfluxDB

> InfluxDB is a high-performance time series database optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data.

## Overview
InfluxDB is a purpose-built database designed to handle time series data, which is data indexed by time. It was created to efficiently store and analyze metrics and events, making it ideal for monitoring, IoT, and real-time analytics.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Time series data is central to InfluxDB, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of time-stamped data.
- It uses a columnar database structure optimized for time-based queries and high ingestion rates.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **High Write and Query Performance**: Optimized for fast data ingestion and querying.
- **Retention Policies**: Automatically manage data lifecycle with retention policies.
- **Built-in Time Series Functions**: Provides functions for downsampling, aggregation, and transformation.
- **Schema Flexibility**: No need for predefined schemas, allowing for dynamic data structures.
- **Integration and Ecosystem**: Supports integration with popular tools like Grafana for visualization.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Limited Transaction Support**: Not designed for complex transactions or relational data.
- **Scalability Concerns**: May require careful planning and management for horizontal scaling.
- **Data Precision**: Precision can be limited by storage and retention settings.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: You need to store and analyze large volumes of time-stamped data, such as monitoring server metrics or IoT sensor data.
- **Avoid When**: You require complex transactions or need to store non-time series relational data.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Monitoring systems like Prometheus, IoT data collection, and real-time analytics dashboards.
- **Alternatives**: Prometheus for monitoring, TimescaleDB for PostgreSQL compatibility, and OpenTSDB for Hadoop integration.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"InfluxDB is just for DevOps"**: While popular in DevOps, it's also suitable for IoT and financial data.
- **"InfluxDB can't scale"**: It can scale, but requires careful architecture planning.
