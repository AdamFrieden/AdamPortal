# Downsampling & Retention Policies

> **Takeaway**: Downsampling and retention policies are crucial for managing time-series data efficiently, balancing storage costs, and ensuring data relevance over time.

## Core idea
- **Downsampling**: The process of reducing the resolution of time-series data by aggregating data points over a specified interval. It helps in minimizing storage requirements and improving query performance.
- **Retention Policies**: Rules that define how long data should be kept at different resolutions. They ensure that only relevant data is retained, optimizing storage and retrieval costs.
- **Importance**: Both techniques are essential for handling large volumes of time-series data, particularly in IoT, monitoring, and analytics applications.

## Key features
- **Storage Optimization**: Reduces the amount of data stored by aggregating older data, thus lowering storage costs.
- **Performance Improvement**: Enhances query performance by reducing the amount of data to be processed.
- **Data Relevance**: Ensures that only the most relevant data is retained over time, which is crucial for long-term analysis.
- **Scalability**: Supports the efficient scaling of systems by managing data growth effectively.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use It**: To manage large datasets efficiently, reduce storage costs, and maintain system performance.
- **When to Use It**: Ideal for systems with high-frequency data generation, such as IoT devices, financial tick data, or server monitoring logs.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Over-aggressive downsampling can lead to loss of critical data insights. Retention policies need to be carefully balanced to avoid premature data deletion.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Define a downsampling policy
CREATE DOWNSAMPLE POLICY
  ON measurement
  RESAMPLE EVERY 1h
  AGGREGATE AVG(value)

# Define a retention policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY
  ON measurement
  DURATION 30d
  REPLICATION 1
```

## Real-world applications
- **IoT Platforms**: Managing sensor data by retaining high-resolution data for recent periods and downsampling older data.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Retaining detailed logs for recent events and summarizing older logs to maintain historical trends.
- **Financial Services**: Handling high-frequency trading data by keeping detailed records for recent trades and aggregated data for historical analysis.
