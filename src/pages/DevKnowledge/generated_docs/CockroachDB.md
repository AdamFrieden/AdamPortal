# CockroachDB

> CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database designed for high availability, strong consistency, and global scalability.

## Overview
CockroachDB is an open-source, cloud-native SQL database that aims to provide a resilient and scalable solution for modern applications. It was created to address the limitations of traditional databases in handling distributed workloads, offering a system that can survive hardware failures and scale horizontally without manual sharding.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Distributed architecture that automatically replicates and balances data across nodes.
- Strong consistency using a consensus protocol (Raft) to ensure data integrity.
- SQL interface for ease of use and compatibility with existing applications.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Seamlessly add nodes to increase capacity and performance.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover and data replication ensure high availability.
- **Global Distribution**: Geographically distribute data to reduce latency and comply with data residency requirements.
- **ACID Transactions**: Support for complex transactions with strong consistency guarantees.
- **Familiar SQL Interface**: Use standard SQL queries and tools, minimizing the learning curve.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Distributed systems can be complex to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Latency**: Global distribution can introduce latency due to network delays.
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires careful resource planning to optimize performance and cost.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When building applications that require high availability, global distribution, and strong consistency.
- **Avoid**: For simple, single-node applications or when low-latency is critical and cannot be compromised.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Financial services, e-commerce platforms, and SaaS applications needing global reach.
- **Alternatives**: Amazon Aurora, Google Spanner, and PostgreSQL for different scalability and consistency needs.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: CockroachDB is only for large-scale applications.
  - **Reality**: It can be used for small to medium applications that anticipate growth.
- **Myth**: It is a NoSQL database.
  - **Reality**: CockroachDB is a SQL database with NoSQL-like scalability.
