# CQRS

> CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

## Overview
CQRS is an architectural pattern that divides a system into two distinct parts: one for handling commands (write operations) and another for handling queries (read operations). This separation allows for optimized performance, scalability, and flexibility in complex systems by addressing different concerns independently.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Separation of Concerns**: Commands change state, while queries read state.
- **Optimized Data Models**: Different data models can be used for reads and writes, tailored to their specific needs.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Scalability**: Enables independent scaling of read and write workloads.
- **Performance**: Optimizes read and write operations separately, improving overall system performance.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for different storage technologies and data models for reads and writes.
- **Complexity Management**: Simplifies complex domains by separating command and query logic.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Increased Complexity**: Introduces additional architectural complexity and potential for data consistency issues.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Systems may become eventually consistent, which can be challenging to manage.
- **Development Overhead**: Requires more effort in designing and maintaining separate models and infrastructure.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: High scalability and performance are required, and the domain is complex enough to justify the separation.
- **Avoid When**: Simplicity is a priority, or the system does not have significant scalability or performance demands.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Event sourcing systems, large-scale e-commerce platforms.
- **Alternatives**: Microservices, traditional CRUD architectures, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) without CQRS.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Not Always Event Sourcing**: CQRS does not inherently require event sourcing, though they are often used together.
- **Not a Silver Bullet**: CQRS is not suitable for all systems and should be applied judiciously.
