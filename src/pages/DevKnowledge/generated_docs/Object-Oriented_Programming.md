# Object-Oriented Programming

> A programming paradigm using "objects" to model real-world entities and relationships.

## Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It exists to manage complexity in large software systems by modeling real-world entities and their interactions.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data with methods that operate on that data.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing entities to be treated as instances of their parent class.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into discrete objects, making it easier to manage.
- **Reusability**: Inheritance and polymorphism enable code reuse and extension.
- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation and abstraction simplify maintenance and updates.
- **Scalability**: OOP designs can be more easily scaled as systems grow.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Overuse of objects and inheritance can lead to convoluted designs.
- **Performance**: OOP can introduce overhead due to abstraction layers.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When modeling complex systems with clear hierarchies and relationships.
- **Avoid**: For simple scripts or when performance is a critical concern.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Java, C++, Python (with classes).
- **Alternatives**: Functional Programming (e.g., Haskell, Scala), Procedural Programming (e.g., C).

## Common Misconceptions
- **OOP is not always the best choice**: It's not a one-size-fits-all solution.
- **Objects are not just data structures**: They encapsulate behavior as well.
