# FUSE / Filesystem in Userspace

> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows the creation of custom filesystems without modifying kernel code, enabling rapid development and testing of new filesystem concepts in user space.

## Core idea
- **User-space Filesystem Development**: FUSE enables the development of filesystems in user space, avoiding the need for kernel-level programming, which can be complex and risky.
- **Kernel Module**: It consists of a kernel module (`fuse.ko`) and a user-space library (`libfuse`), which communicate via a well-defined API.
- **Flexibility and Safety**: By operating in user space, FUSE provides a safer environment for filesystem experimentation, reducing the risk of system crashes.

## Key features
- **Portability**: FUSE is available on various Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD, making it a versatile choice for cross-platform filesystem development.
- **Ease of Use**: The user-space API is simpler compared to kernel programming, allowing developers to focus on functionality rather than kernel intricacies.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Ideal for prototyping new filesystem ideas or implementing specialized filesystems for specific applications.
- **Security**: Running in user space limits the potential damage from bugs or vulnerabilities, as they do not directly affect the kernel.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use FUSE**: Use FUSE when you need to create a custom filesystem quickly, test new filesystem concepts, or implement a filesystem that interacts with user-space applications.
- **When to Use FUSE**: Ideal for non-performance-critical applications, such as network filesystems, virtual filesystems, or filesystems that aggregate data from multiple sources.
- **Common Pitfalls**: FUSE filesystems may suffer from performance overhead due to context switching between user space and kernel space. Avoid using FUSE for high-performance or latency-sensitive applications.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Example: Mounting a simple FUSE filesystem
# 1. Install FUSE and libfuse
# 2. Write a simple FUSE application in C or Python
# 3. Compile and run the application
# 4. Mount the filesystem using the FUSE application
# 5. Interact with the filesystem using standard file operations
```

## Real-world applications
- **SSHFS**: A FUSE-based filesystem that allows mounting remote directories over SSH, providing secure access to remote files.
- **GlusterFS**: A scalable network filesystem that uses FUSE to provide a unified storage solution across multiple servers.
- **EncFS**: An encrypted filesystem that uses FUSE to provide transparent encryption of files.
