# Apache Kafka

> Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data processing.

## Overview
Apache Kafka is an open-source platform designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was developed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data feeds, enabling organizations to process and analyze data in real-time. Kafka is widely used for its ability to decouple data streams and provide a robust, scalable solution for managing data flow across distributed systems.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Kafka acts as a distributed commit log, storing streams of records in a fault-tolerant manner.
- It decouples data producers and consumers, allowing for scalable and flexible data processing.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more brokers.
- **Durability**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling millions of messages per second.
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports real-time data streaming and processing.
- **Decoupling**: Separates data producers and consumers, simplifying system architecture.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Requires careful configuration and management.
- **Latency**: While low, it may not be suitable for ultra-low latency requirements.
- **Operational Overhead**: Managing a Kafka cluster can be resource-intensive.
- **Data Retention**: Misconfigured retention policies can lead to data loss or excessive storage use.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need to process large volumes of data in real-time, require high availability, and need to decouple data producers and consumers.
- **Avoid**: For simple message queuing needs or when ultra-low latency is critical.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Log aggregation, real-time analytics, event sourcing, and stream processing.
- **Alternatives**: RabbitMQ, Amazon Kinesis, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and Apache Pulsar.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Kafka is a database**: It is not; Kafka is designed for streaming data, not for querying or storing data long-term.
- **Kafka replaces all message brokers**: It excels in high-throughput scenarios but may not be ideal for all messaging needs.
