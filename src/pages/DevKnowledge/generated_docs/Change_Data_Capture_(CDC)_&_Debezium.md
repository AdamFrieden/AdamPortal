# Change Data Capture (CDC) & Debezium

> Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to identify and capture changes made to data in a database, enabling real-time data integration and synchronization. Debezium is an open-source CDC platform that simplifies capturing and streaming changes from databases to various consumers.

## Core idea
- **CDC Fundamentals**: CDC captures changes in data as they occur, allowing systems to react to these changes in real-time. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency across distributed systems.
- **Importance**: It enables real-time analytics, data replication, and event-driven architectures by ensuring that data changes are propagated efficiently and accurately.
- **Debezium's Role**: Debezium acts as a bridge between databases and event streaming platforms, providing a reliable way to stream database changes to systems like Apache Kafka.

## Key features
- **Database Support**: Debezium supports a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more, making it versatile for different environments.
- **Event Streaming**: It integrates seamlessly with Apache Kafka, allowing changes to be published as events that can be consumed by various applications.
- **Schema Evolution**: Debezium handles schema changes gracefully, ensuring that consumers can adapt to changes in the database schema without disruption.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built on Kafka, Debezium inherits Kafka's fault tolerance and scalability, ensuring reliable data capture and delivery.

## Why / When / How
- **When to Use**: Ideal for scenarios requiring real-time data synchronization, such as microservices architectures, real-time analytics, and data warehousing.
- **Why Use**: It reduces the complexity of data integration by providing a consistent and reliable mechanism for capturing and streaming data changes.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Not suitable for systems with high write latency requirements or where the overhead of capturing every change is prohibitive. Also, careful consideration is needed for handling data privacy and security.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Debezium setup with Kafka Connect
1. Start Kafka and Zookeeper
2. Configure Kafka Connect with Debezium connector
3. Deploy Debezium connector for a specific database
4. Consume change events from Kafka topics
```

## Real-world applications
- **E-commerce**: Synchronizing inventory data across multiple systems in real-time.
- **Financial Services**: Real-time fraud detection by monitoring transaction changes.
- **Healthcare**: Keeping patient records synchronized across different systems for up-to-date information access.
