# Pure Functions

> Pure functions are deterministic and side-effect-free, ensuring predictable and testable code.

## Overview
Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming. They exist to create predictable and reliable code by ensuring that functions have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- A pure function's output is determined solely by its input values.
- Pure functions do not modify any external state or rely on external state changes.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Predictability**: Given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output.
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test due to their deterministic nature.
- **Concurrency**: They can be executed in parallel without concerns about shared state.
- **Composability**: Pure functions can be easily combined to build more complex operations.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Performance**: Pure functions may require more memory or processing due to the avoidance of mutable state.
- **Complexity**: Overuse can lead to complex code structures, especially when dealing with I/O operations.
- **State Management**: Managing state without side effects can be challenging and may require additional patterns like monads.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need predictable, testable, and maintainable code, especially in concurrent or parallel processing.
- **Avoid**: In scenarios where performance is critical and the overhead of avoiding side effects is too high.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Functional programming languages like Haskell and libraries like Lodash in JavaScript.
- **Alternatives**: Object-oriented programming patterns or imperative approaches when side effects are necessary.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Pure functions are only useful in functional programming languages.
- **Myth**: Pure functions cannot handle real-world applications involving I/O.
