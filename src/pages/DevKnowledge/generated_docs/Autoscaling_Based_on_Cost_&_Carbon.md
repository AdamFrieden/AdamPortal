# Autoscaling Based on Cost & Carbon

> Autoscaling based on cost and carbon is an advanced strategy that optimizes cloud resource usage by dynamically adjusting capacity according to financial and environmental considerations. This approach helps organizations reduce expenses and carbon footprints while maintaining performance.

## Core idea
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Adjusts cloud resources in real-time based on cost and carbon emissions, ensuring optimal use of infrastructure.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizes expenses by scaling resources according to demand and cost metrics, avoiding over-provisioning.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduces carbon emissions by considering the carbon intensity of data centers and shifting workloads to greener regions when possible.
- **Sustainability Goals**: Aligns with corporate sustainability initiatives by integrating environmental considerations into IT operations.

## Key features
- **Cost-Aware Scaling**: Utilizes cost metrics to scale resources up or down, optimizing for budget constraints.
- **Carbon-Aware Scheduling**: Incorporates carbon intensity data to prioritize low-carbon regions or times for running workloads.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Employs machine learning to forecast demand and carbon intensity, enabling proactive scaling decisions.
- **Policy-Driven Automation**: Allows for customizable policies that balance cost, performance, and carbon emissions.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use It**: To achieve cost savings and reduce environmental impact while maintaining service levels.
- **When to Use It**: Ideal for organizations with fluctuating workloads, sustainability goals, or those operating in multi-region cloud environments.
- **How to Implement**: Integrate with cloud provider APIs for cost and carbon data, use automation tools for dynamic scaling, and establish policies for decision-making.
- **Pitfalls**: Over-reliance on automation without proper oversight can lead to unexpected costs or performance issues. Not suitable for workloads with strict latency or compliance requirements.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudo-code for autoscaling based on cost and carbon
while true:
    current_cost = get_current_cost()
    current_carbon_intensity = get_carbon_intensity()
    if current_cost > budget_threshold or current_carbon_intensity > carbon_threshold:
        scale_down_resources()
    else if demand_forecast > current_capacity:
        scale_up_resources()
    sleep(check_interval)
```

## Real-world applications
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Scale resources during peak shopping periods while minimizing costs and emissions.
- **Media Streaming Services**: Adjust capacity based on viewer demand and carbon intensity of data centers.
- **Financial Services**: Optimize compute resources for trading applications, balancing cost and sustainability.
