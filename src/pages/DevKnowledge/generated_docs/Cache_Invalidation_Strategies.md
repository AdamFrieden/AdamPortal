# Cache Invalidation Strategies

> Cache invalidation is a critical aspect of maintaining data consistency and performance in distributed systems. It ensures that cached data remains fresh and relevant, balancing between performance gains and data accuracy.

## Core idea
- **Definition**: Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating stale data in a cache to ensure that the data served is current and accurate.
- **Importance**: Essential for maintaining data consistency across distributed systems where data changes frequently.
- **Challenges**: Balancing the trade-off between cache hit rates (performance) and data freshness (accuracy).

## Key features
- **Time-based Invalidation**: Uses TTL (Time-to-Live) to automatically invalidate cache entries after a specified period.
- **Event-based Invalidation**: Triggers invalidation based on specific events or changes in the underlying data source.
- **Manual Invalidation**: Directly controlled by the application logic, allowing precise control over cache entries.
- **Write-through/Write-behind**: Ensures data consistency by updating the cache immediately or asynchronously after a data source update.

## Why / When / How
- **Why**: To ensure that users receive the most up-to-date information while leveraging the performance benefits of caching.
- **When**: Use when data consistency is critical, and the underlying data changes frequently.
- **How**: Choose the appropriate strategy based on application requirements, data change frequency, and acceptable levels of staleness.
- **Pitfalls**: Over-invalidation can lead to performance degradation, while under-invalidation can result in serving stale data. Avoid complex invalidation logic that can introduce bugs and increase system complexity.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Time-based Invalidation Example
cache.set("user_profile", user_data, ttl=3600)  # Cache user profile for 1 hour

# Event-based Invalidation Example
on_user_update(user_id):
    cache.invalidate("user_profile:" + user_id)  # Invalidate cache on user update
```

## Real-world applications
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Use cache invalidation to ensure that web content is up-to-date while minimizing latency.
- **Database Caching**: Systems like Redis or Memcached use various invalidation strategies to keep cached data synchronized with the database.
- **Web Applications**: Front-end frameworks often use cache invalidation to manage state and data consistency in single-page applications.
