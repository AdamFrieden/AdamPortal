# Distributed Tracing

> Distributed tracing tracks requests across microservices to diagnose performance issues and improve system observability.

## Overview
Distributed tracing is a method used to monitor and track requests as they propagate through a distributed system. It exists to provide visibility into complex, microservice-based architectures, helping engineers understand the flow of requests and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Each request is assigned a unique trace ID, allowing it to be tracked across service boundaries.
- Spans represent individual units of work within a trace, capturing timing and metadata.
- Traces and spans together form a tree-like structure that maps the request's journey.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **End-to-End Visibility**: Provides a comprehensive view of request paths across services.
- **Performance Bottleneck Identification**: Helps pinpoint slow services or operations.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Facilitates faster diagnosis of issues by showing where errors occur.
- **Service Dependency Mapping**: Visualizes interactions and dependencies between services.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Overhead**: Instrumentation can add latency and resource consumption.
- **Complexity**: Requires consistent implementation across services.
- **Data Volume**: Large volumes of trace data can be challenging to store and analyze.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use When**: Operating a microservices architecture with complex service interactions.
- **Avoid When**: Working with simple, monolithic applications where traditional logging suffices.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry.
- **Alternatives**: Traditional logging, Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"It's just logging"**: Unlike logging, distributed tracing provides a structured view of request flows.
- **"Only for microservices"**: While most beneficial for microservices, it can also aid in monolithic systems with complex internal interactions.
