# Event & Stream Processing

> Event & stream processing enables real-time data handling and analysis, crucial for systems requiring immediate insights and actions. It is foundational in modern architectures for handling continuous data flows efficiently.

## Core idea
- **Event Processing**: Involves capturing, analyzing, and responding to events (changes in state) in real-time. Events are discrete, often representing significant occurrences.
- **Stream Processing**: Deals with continuous data streams, allowing for real-time data ingestion, processing, and output. It focuses on handling data as it arrives, rather than storing it first.
- **Importance**: Enables real-time analytics, monitoring, and decision-making, crucial for applications like fraud detection, IoT, and live content delivery.

## Key features
- **Low Latency**: Processes data in near real-time, providing immediate insights.
- **Scalability**: Can handle high-throughput data streams, scaling horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures data processing continues seamlessly despite failures, often through distributed systems.
- **Complex Event Processing (CEP)**: Allows for pattern detection and correlation across multiple events, enabling sophisticated analytics.

## Why / When / How
- **Why Use It**: Essential for applications requiring real-time data processing and immediate response, such as financial trading platforms, real-time analytics dashboards, and IoT systems.
- **When to Use It**: When the value of data diminishes over time and immediate insights are critical.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Overhead of maintaining state and ensuring consistency can be challenging. Not suitable for batch processing or scenarios where data latency is acceptable.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Pseudo-code for a simple stream processing pipeline
stream = read_stream("sensor_data")
processed_stream = stream.filter(event => event.value > threshold)
processed_stream.map(event => alert(event))
```

## Real-world applications
- **Financial Services**: Real-time fraud detection and algorithmic trading.
- **Telecommunications**: Monitoring and optimizing network performance.
- **E-commerce**: Personalized recommendations and dynamic pricing.
- **IoT**: Real-time monitoring and control of connected devices.
