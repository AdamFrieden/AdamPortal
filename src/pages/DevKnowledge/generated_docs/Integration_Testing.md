# Integration Testing

> Integration testing verifies the interaction between integrated units to ensure they work together as expected.

## Overview
Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components are combined and tested as a group. It exists to identify issues in the interaction between integrated units, which unit tests might not catch. This testing phase is crucial for detecting interface defects and ensuring that different parts of a system work together seamlessly.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Focuses on the interaction between components rather than the functionality of individual units.
- Ensures that integrated components produce the expected outcomes when combined.

## Key Features & Benefits
- Detects interface defects early in the development cycle.
- Validates data flow and control logic between modules.
- Helps ensure that integrated components meet system requirements.
- Can be automated to improve efficiency and consistency.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- Can be complex and time-consuming to set up and maintain.
- May require extensive test data and environment configuration.
- Risk of focusing too much on integration and neglecting unit or system testing.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use when**: You need to verify interactions between modules, especially after significant changes or integrations.
- **Avoid when**: Testing isolated units or when integration points are not yet stable.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: JUnit, TestNG, and PyTest for automated integration tests.
- **Services**: CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) often include integration testing stages.
- **Patterns**: Microservices architecture often requires robust integration testing to ensure service interoperability.

## Common Misconceptions
- Integration testing is not a substitute for unit testing.
- It does not cover end-to-end testing, which includes user interfaces and external systems.
- It is not only applicable to large systems; even small applications can benefit.
