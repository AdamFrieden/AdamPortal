# Pulumi

> Pulumi is an infrastructure as code tool that uses familiar programming languages to manage cloud resources.

## Overview
Pulumi is a modern infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that allows developers to define and manage cloud infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#. It exists to bridge the gap between development and operations by enabling developers to use their existing programming skills to manage infrastructure.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Treat infrastructure as code using familiar programming languages.
- Leverage existing software development practices (e.g., testing, version control) for infrastructure management.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Multi-language Support**: Use popular programming languages, reducing the learning curve for developers.
- **Cross-cloud Compatibility**: Manage resources across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.) from a single platform.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access a wide range of libraries and tools to extend functionality.
- **State Management**: Automatically manages the state of your infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure deployment.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: May introduce complexity for teams not familiar with programming languages.
- **State Management**: Requires understanding of state management to avoid potential issues with resource drift.
- **Learning Curve**: Initial setup and learning can be challenging for teams new to IaC.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need to manage complex, multi-cloud environments using familiar programming languages.
- **Avoid**: If your team prefers simpler, declarative IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, or if you have minimal infrastructure needs.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Companies using Pulumi for multi-cloud deployments and infrastructure automation.
- **Alternatives**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager.

## Common Misconceptions
- **"Pulumi is only for developers"**: While developer-friendly, it is also suitable for operations teams.
- **"Pulumi replaces all other IaC tools"**: It complements existing tools and may not be the best fit for all scenarios.
