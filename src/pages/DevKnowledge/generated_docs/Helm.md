# Helm

> Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying application deployment and management.

## Overview
Helm is a tool that streamlines the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes. It exists to address the complexity of Kubernetes resource configuration by providing a templating mechanism and a repository for reusable application definitions, known as charts.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Helm uses charts to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.
- It acts as a bridge between developers and operations, facilitating consistent application deployment.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Chart Repositories**: Centralized storage for sharing and reusing application configurations.
- **Templating**: Parameterize Kubernetes manifests to manage different environments easily.
- **Release Management**: Track and manage application versions and rollbacks.
- **Dependency Management**: Handle complex application dependencies within charts.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Helm charts can become complex and hard to manage for large applications.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of both Kubernetes and Helm-specific concepts.
- **Security**: Charts from public repositories may contain vulnerabilities; always review before use.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When deploying complex applications with multiple Kubernetes resources, or when you need version control and rollback capabilities.
- **Avoid**: For simple applications with minimal resources, or when Kubernetes-native tools suffice.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Deploying microservices architectures, managing CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes.
- **Alternatives**: Kustomize for configuration management, ArgoCD for GitOps workflows.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Helm is not Kubernetes**: It's a tool that works with Kubernetes, not a replacement.
- **Helm is not a CI/CD tool**: It manages application releases, not the entire CI/CD pipeline.
