# Infrastructure as Code

> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure management using code, enhancing consistency, efficiency, and scalability.

## Overview
Infrastructure as Code is a practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It exists to streamline the deployment process, reduce errors, and enable version control for infrastructure.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Treat infrastructure like application code: version-controlled, tested, and automated.
- Use declarative or imperative programming to define infrastructure configurations.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity across environments, reducing configuration drift.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are tracked, enabling rollback and auditing.
- **Automation**: Speeds up deployment and scaling processes, reducing manual intervention.
- **Reproducibility**: Easily replicate environments for testing, staging, and production.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Initial setup and learning curve can be steep.
- **Overhead**: Requires maintenance of code and infrastructure definitions.
- **Tooling Limitations**: Some tools may not support all desired configurations or platforms.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When deploying complex, scalable, and repeatable environments; when consistency and version control are critical.
- **Avoid**: For small, static environments where manual configuration is sufficient and changes are infrequent.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet, Chef.
- **Alternatives**: Managed services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku for simpler use cases.

## Common Misconceptions
- **IaC is only for cloud**: It can be used for on-premises infrastructure as well.
- **IaC eliminates all manual work**: Some manual intervention may still be necessary for unique configurations.
