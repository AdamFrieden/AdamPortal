# Immutable Infrastructure

> Immutable Infrastructure refers to a paradigm where servers or system components are not modified after deployment. Instead, any changes require provisioning new instances, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Core idea
- **Consistency**: Immutable infrastructure ensures that all environments (development, testing, production) are consistent, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Reliability**: By deploying new instances for updates, systems are less prone to configuration drift and unexpected failures.
- **Rollback**: Simplifies rollback processes by switching to previous versions without complex state management.
- **Automation**: Encourages automation in deployment processes, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error.

## Key features
- **Versioning**: Infrastructure is versioned, similar to code, allowing for precise control over deployments.
- **Reproducibility**: Environments can be reproduced exactly, aiding in debugging and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates horizontal scaling by deploying identical instances.
- **Security**: Reduces attack surface by minimizing the need for SSH access and manual configuration changes.

## Why / When / How
- **Why use it**: To achieve high reliability, consistency, and ease of management in cloud-native applications.
- **When to use it**: Ideal for cloud environments, microservices architectures, and CI/CD pipelines where rapid, consistent deployments are crucial.
- **How to implement**: Use tools like Docker, Terraform, or AWS AMIs to create immutable images and automate deployment processes.
- **Pitfalls**: Not suitable for systems requiring frequent, minor updates or where stateful configurations are necessary. Initial setup can be complex and resource-intensive.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Example using Terraform and Docker
# Define infrastructure as code
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

# Dockerfile for immutable application container
FROM node:14
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

# Deploy new version
# 1. Build new Docker image
docker build -t myapp:v2 .

# 2. Update Terraform configuration with new AMI or container version
# 3. Apply changes
terraform apply
```

## Real-world applications
- **Netflix**: Uses immutable infrastructure to deploy and manage its microservices architecture, ensuring consistent environments across its global operations.
- **AWS Lambda**: Functions are deployed as immutable artifacts, promoting rapid scaling and consistent execution environments.
