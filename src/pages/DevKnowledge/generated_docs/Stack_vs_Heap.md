# Stack vs Heap

> Understanding stack and heap memory allocation is crucial for efficient resource management in software development.

## Overview
The stack and heap are two types of memory used for dynamic and static storage in programming. They exist to manage memory allocation efficiently, impacting performance, scope, and lifetime of data.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure for static memory allocation, ideal for short-lived variables.
- **Heap**: Dynamic memory allocation for objects requiring flexible lifetime and size.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Stack**:
  - Fast access due to its LIFO nature.
  - Automatic memory management; memory is freed when a function exits.
  - Predictable memory usage, reducing overhead.
- **Heap**:
  - Flexible size allocation, suitable for objects with unknown size at compile time.
  - Persistent data storage beyond function scope.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Stack**:
  - Limited size; risk of stack overflow with deep recursion or large allocations.
  - Not suitable for large or complex data structures.
- **Heap**:
  - Slower access due to dynamic allocation.
  - Requires manual memory management, leading to potential memory leaks.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use Stack**: For small, short-lived variables and when performance is critical.
- **Avoid Stack**: For large data structures or when data needs to persist beyond function calls.
- **Use Heap**: For large, complex data structures or when data needs to persist.
- **Avoid Heap**: When performance is critical and memory management overhead is undesirable.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Stack**: Local variables in C/C++ functions.
- **Heap**: Java objects managed by the garbage collector.
- **Alternatives**: Memory pools or arenas for custom allocation strategies.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Heap is always slower than stack" — Heap can be optimized with efficient allocation strategies.
- "Stack is unlimited" — Stack size is limited and can lead to overflow.
