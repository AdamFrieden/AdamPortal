> Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers.

## Overview
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. It was created to simplify the process of managing application dependencies and environments, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production stages.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Encapsulate applications and their dependencies in containers that can run consistently across any environment.
- Containers are isolated but share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring consistent environments.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and start quickly, using fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications by deploying multiple container instances.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, reducing conflicts between applications.
- **Version Control**: Docker images can be versioned, allowing for easy rollbacks and updates.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Complexity**: Managing a large number of containers can become complex without proper orchestration tools.
- **Security**: Containers share the host OS kernel, which can pose security risks if not properly managed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Handling data persistence requires additional configuration and management.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When you need consistent environments across development and production, or when deploying microservices.
- **Avoid**: For applications requiring heavy GUI interaction or when the overhead of containerization outweighs the benefits.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Microservices architectures, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native applications.
- **Alternatives**: Podman, Kubernetes (for orchestration), and traditional virtual machines for full isolation.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Containers are the same as virtual machines.
  - **Fact**: Containers share the host OS kernel, unlike VMs which include a full OS.
- **Myth**: Docker is only for microservices.
  - **Fact**: Docker can be used for any application that benefits from isolation and portability.
