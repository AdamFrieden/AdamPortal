# Health Checks

> Health checks are automated diagnostics for assessing the operational status of software systems.

## Overview
Health checks are mechanisms used to determine the health and availability of a software application or service. They exist to provide real-time insights into system performance, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Health checks act as a system's "heartbeat," continuously monitoring and reporting on its operational status.
- They provide a binary result: healthy or unhealthy, often with additional diagnostic information.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Early Detection**: Identify issues before they escalate into critical failures.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous, real-time assessment without manual intervention.
- **Integration**: Easily integrate with monitoring tools and alerting systems.
- **Scalability**: Supports distributed systems by ensuring each component is operational.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **False Positives/Negatives**: Incorrect configurations can lead to misleading health statuses.
- **Performance Overhead**: Frequent checks may consume resources, impacting performance.
- **Complexity**: Overly complex health checks can be difficult to maintain and debug.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: In production environments to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Avoid**: In development environments where rapid changes may trigger false alarms.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Tools**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, AWS Elastic Load Balancing health checks.
- **Alternatives**: Circuit breakers and service meshes for more complex dependency management.

## Common Misconceptions
- **Myth**: Health checks can prevent all system failures.
  - **Reality**: They only detect symptoms, not root causes.
- **Myth**: More frequent checks always improve reliability.
  - **Reality**: They can increase load and lead to false positives.
