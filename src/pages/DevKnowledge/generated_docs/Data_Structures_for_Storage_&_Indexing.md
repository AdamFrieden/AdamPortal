# Data Structures for Storage & Indexing

> Efficient data storage and retrieval are critical for performance in software systems. Understanding the right data structures for storage and indexing can significantly enhance system efficiency and scalability.

## Core idea
- Data structures for storage and indexing are designed to organize and manage data efficiently, enabling quick access, modification, and storage.
- They are crucial for database systems, file systems, and any application requiring fast data retrieval.
- The choice of data structure impacts the performance of operations such as search, insert, delete, and update.

## Key features
- **Arrays and Linked Lists**: Simple structures for sequential storage, offering fast access and insertion but limited by linear search times.
- **Hash Tables**: Provide average constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, ideal for associative arrays and caches.
- **Trees (e.g., B-Trees, AVL Trees)**: Support hierarchical data storage with logarithmic time complexity for search and updates, commonly used in databases and file systems.
- **Graphs**: Model complex relationships and networks, essential for applications like social networks and route optimization.
- **Indexes**: Specialized data structures (e.g., B-Trees, R-Trees) that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database at the cost of additional storage space.

## Why / When / How
- **Why**: To optimize data retrieval and manipulation, reducing latency and improving user experience.
- **When**: Use when dealing with large datasets where performance is a concern, such as in databases, search engines, and real-time systems.
- **How**: Choose based on data characteristics and access patterns. For example, use hash tables for fast lookup, trees for sorted data, and graphs for relational data.
- **Pitfalls**: Avoid complex structures for small datasets due to overhead. Be cautious of memory usage and maintenance complexity, especially with dynamic data.

## Example / Walk-through
```pseudo
# Example of a simple B-Tree insertion
initialize B-Tree with order m
insert key into B-Tree
  if node is full
    split node
    promote middle key to parent
  else
    insert key in sorted order
```

## Real-world applications
- **Databases**: Use B-Trees and hash indexes for efficient query processing.
- **File Systems**: Employ B-Trees for directory indexing and file retrieval.
- **Web Applications**: Utilize hash tables for session management and caching.
- **Search Engines**: Implement inverted indexes for fast text search.
