# Functional Programming

> A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability and avoiding side effects.

## Overview
Functional programming (FP) is a paradigm designed to handle computation through pure functions, avoiding shared state and mutable data. It exists to simplify reasoning about code, improve modularity, and facilitate parallel processing.

## Core Idea / Mental Model
- Functions are first-class citizens: they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- Emphasizes immutability: data is not modified after creation.
- Avoids side effects: functions do not alter state or interact with the outside world.

## Key Features & Benefits
- **Pure Functions**: Consistent outputs for the same inputs, simplifying debugging and testing.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that operate on other functions, enabling powerful abstractions.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Delays computation until necessary, potentially improving performance.
- **Concurrency**: Easier to achieve due to immutability and lack of side effects.

## Trade-offs & Pitfalls
- **Learning Curve**: Can be steep for those accustomed to imperative programming.
- **Performance**: May be less efficient for certain tasks due to immutability and recursion.
- **Debugging**: Stack traces can be harder to interpret due to function composition.

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- **Use**: When building concurrent systems, data transformation pipelines, or when immutability is crucial.
- **Avoid**: In performance-critical applications where low-level optimizations are necessary, or when team familiarity is low.

## Real-World Examples & Modern Alternatives
- **Examples**: Haskell, Clojure, Scala.
- **Alternatives**: Object-oriented programming, procedural programming.

## Common Misconceptions
- "FP is only for academics": Widely used in industry, especially in data processing and concurrent systems.
- "FP languages are slow": Modern compilers and optimizations mitigate many performance concerns.
